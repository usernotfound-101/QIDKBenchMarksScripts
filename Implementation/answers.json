      "question": "Why is fluoric acid weak but etches glass?",
      "answer": "Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is chemically 'weak' because it does not fully dissociate into ions in water due to the strong bond between hydrogen and fluorine. However, it etches glass because the fluoride ion has a specific, high affinity for silicon, allowing it to attack the silicon dioxide (SiO₂) in glass to form gaseous silicon tetrafluoride."
