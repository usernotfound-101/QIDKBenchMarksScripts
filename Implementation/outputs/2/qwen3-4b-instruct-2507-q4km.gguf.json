        "question": "Why do some people have dimples?",
        "answer": "Some people have dimples because of a genetic trait that is inherited from their parents. The presence of dimples is controlled by a single gene with two alleles, one dominant and one recessive. If a person inherits two copies of the dominant allele, they will have dimples. If they inherit one dominant and one recessive allele, they will have dimples. If they inherit two recessive alleles, they will not have dimples."
