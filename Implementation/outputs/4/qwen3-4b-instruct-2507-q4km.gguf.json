        "question": "Why is fluoric acid weak but etches glass?",
        "answer": "Fluoric acid is weak because it only partially ionizes in water, meaning it doesn't release many hydrogen ions. However, it etches glass because it reacts with silicon dioxide (SiO₂) in glass to form volatile silicon tetrafluoride (SiF₄), which escapes, leaving a smooth surface."
