        "question": "Why does something look smaller when traveling at the speed of light?",
        "answer": "It's not possible to travel at the speed of light. Objects with mass cannot reach the speed of light, and as they approach it, time dilation and length contraction occur. As a result, objects appear shorter in the direction of motion, but this is due to relativistic effects, not a visual illusion."
