        "question": "Tell me about the rock cycle",
        "answer": "The rock cycle is the continuous process by which rocks are formed, transformed, and destroyed. It starts with igneous rocks, which are formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. Igneous rocks can be either intrusive (formed below the Earth's surface) or extrusive (formed above the Earth's surface)."
