        "question": "Tell me about the life cycle of rocks, starting from Igneous.",
        "answer": "The rock cycle begins with igneous rocks, which are formed from the cooling and solidification of molten rock, either magma below the Earth's surface or lava above it. These igneous rocks can then be weathered and eroded, forming sediments, which are compacted and cemented together to create sedimentary rocks, or they can be subjected to intense heat and pressure, transforming them into metamorphic rocks."
