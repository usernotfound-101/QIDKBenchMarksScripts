    "question": "Why do some people have dimples?",
    "gold_answer": "Dimples are generally caused by a genetic variation in facial muscle structure, specifically the zygomaticus major muscle. In people with dimples, this muscle is often bifid (split), causing the skin to indent when the muscle contracts during a smile.",
    "best_model": "Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q5_K_S.gguf",
    "model_answer": "Dimples are small indentations in the skin, typically found on the cheeks. They are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including the shape of the facial bones and the way the skin folds over the jawline.",

    "gold_answer": "This phenomenon is known as Lorentz contraction (or length contraction). According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, as an object moves at a velocity approaching the speed of light relative to an observer, its length appears to shorten in the direction of motion.",

    "question": "Why is fluoric acid weak but etches glass?",
    "gold_answer": "Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is chemically 'weak' because it does not fully dissociate into ions in water due to the strong bond between hydrogen and fluorine. However, it etches glass because the fluoride ion has a specific, high affinity for silicon, allowing it to attack the silicon dioxide (SiO₂) in glass to form gaseous silicon tetrafluoride.",
    "best_model": "qwen3-4b-instruct-2507-q4km.gguf",
    "model_answer": "Fluoric acid is weak because it only partially ionizes in water, meaning it doesn't release many hydrogen ions. However, it etches glass because it reacts with silicon dioxide (SiO₂) in glass to form volatile silicon tetrafluoride (SiF₄), which escapes, leaving a smooth surface.",

    "gold_answer": "Starting with Igneous rocks (formed from cooling magma/lava), the cycle proceeds as follows: Weathering and erosion break them into sediments; these sediments undergo compaction and cementation to form Sedimentary rocks; heat and pressure transform these into Metamorphic rocks; finally, extreme heat melts them back into magma, restarting the cycle.",
