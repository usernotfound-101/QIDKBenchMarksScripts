Europe minister David Lidington has become the latest senior figure to land a blow against the High Speed 2 rail link. The Tory MP, whose Aylesbury constituency in Buckinghamshire will be affected by the line, joined the chorus of opposition to HS2 – though as a minister he is duty bound to back the scheme. He raised fears over the spiralling cost – now at £42.6billion – and noise of the trains. In a letter to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Mr Lidington came close to calling for the project to be scrapped after its budget soared by £10 billion. Objections: Europe minister David Lidington is worried about the spiralling cost of the HS2 project . He wrote that constituents had told him this rise ‘gives them no confidence that the final figure will [not] be significantly higher and in the current economic climate that cannot be justified’.

Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 18:53 EST, 7 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:53 EST, 7 July 2013 . Europe minister David Lidington has become the latest senior figure to land a blow against the High Speed 2 rail link. The Tory MP, whose Aylesbury constituency in Buckinghamshire will be affected by the line, joined the chorus of opposition to HS2 – though as a minister he is duty bound to back the scheme. He raised fears over the spiralling cost – now at £42.6billion – and noise of the trains. In a letter to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Mr Lidington came close to calling for the project to be scrapped after its budget soared by £10 billion. Objections: Europe minister David Lidington is worried about the spiralling cost of the HS2 project . He wrote that constituents had told him this rise ‘gives them no confidence that the final figure will [not] be significantly higher and in the current economic climate that cannot be justified’. Voters believed HS2 should be cancelled and the money spent on other infrastructure projects, he added. Mr Lidington also cast doubt on the level of noise those living along the HS2 line would have to endure. In a letter to Alison Munro, HS2’s chief executive, he said the study measuring average noise levels had included the period between midnight and 5am, when no trains run. This had led to ‘very serious underestimates of what my constituents are likely to experience between 11pm and midnight and 5am and 7am’, he said. Mr Lidington has been criticised by some constituents for not backing a rebel attempt to scupper paving legislation for HS2. High speed: Mr Lidington is also worried about late night and early morning noise from the line affecting his Buckinghamshire constituents . But he made clear resigning was a ‘nuclear’ option. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is said to be ‘not a fan’ of the project and former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan has labelled the scheme a ‘boys’ toy’. The Government insists HS2 will boost the economy in the North and that scrapping it would cost close to 100,000 jobs. The first stage, between London and Birmingham, will start in 2017 and finish in 2026. The second stage, to Manchester and Leeds, should be completed by 2033. The line is expected to cut travel times and improve connectivity between major cities.\n\n[summary begin]  \nDavid Lidington, the Europe minister, opposed the High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, citing rising costs—now £42.6 billion—and concerns over noise pollution affecting his Buckinghamshire constituents. He wrote to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin and HS2’s chief executive, questioning the accuracy of noise studies and urging the cancellation of the project due to economic and public concerns. Lidington also faced criticism for not supporting a rebellion against HS2 legislation, despite his objections. Other senior figures, including Owen Paterson and Cheryl Gillan, have also expressed skepticism about the project. The government maintains HS2 will create jobs and improve connectivity, with the first stage expected to begin in 2017 and the full project completed by 2033.  \n[summary end] To summarize the article as requested:  \n[summary begin]  \nDavid Lidington, the Europe minister, opposed HS2, raising concerns over its £42.6 billion cost and noise levels affecting constituents in Buckinghamshire. He criticized the noise study for underestimating nighttime exposure and urged scrapping the project, stating constituents lacked confidence in cost control. He faced backlash for not supporting efforts to block the legislation, despite his objections. Other senior ministers like Owen Paterson and Cheryl Gillan also expressed skepticism. The government argues HS2 will deliver economic benefits and improve connectivity, with the first stage starting in 2017 and full completion by 2033.  \n[summary end]  \nNote: The initial summary was slightly over-structured and included redundant content.

    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A Chris Brown song called \"Not My Fault\" was recorded three years ago and is not about Rihanna, its producers said. Chris Brown pleaded guilty in an assault case regarding his ex-girlfriend Rihanna. The music appeared online Tuesday, a day after the singer admitted guilt to assaulting Rihanna, his former girlfriend. Brown's record label also said the music was not \"new.\" Although Brown accepted a plea deal in which he could avoid jail time, any appearance that he is not remorseful could be damaging, since the judge is not bound by those terms when she sentences him in August. The song, which appeared on YouTube, includes the line \"It's not my fault, right?\" The publicist for the Neptunes, a music producing duo that has worked in the studio with Brown, said the music was a demo recorded three years ago. She said they do not know how the song made its way onto YouTube. Jive Records, which distributes Brown's music, said \"there are no 'new' songs from Chris Brown currently being promoted by Chris or his record label.\" \"There are several old demos circulating that are being falsely promoted as new material from Chris,\" a Jive Records statement said. In the song, Brown sings: . \"I picked up the paper and the headline reads, it says 'singer brokenhearted in some satin sheets.' And I'm like, why? We had a hell of a time.\" \"When I first met you, I told ya that you'll be safe. In the midst of arguing something, falls to the floor and breaks. You look down and see what you dropped, oh, it's your heart.\" \"Shortie's caught up from a long night. She's ready to fall but she's all right. That's just something that can happen when you put it down. She's caught up, it's not my fault, right.\" \"You see, her mama called me, really steamed. She said 'My daughter won't eat and she don't sleep. She just cries.' \" Brown was arrested in connection with an altercation that began with an argument with Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street in February. Prosecutors agreed to recommend five years of probation and 180 days of community service for Brown in exchange for his guilty plea on one count of assault with the intent of doing great bodily injury.",

Chris Brown pleaded guilty in an assault case regarding his ex-girlfriend Rihanna. The music appeared online Tuesday, a day after the singer admitted guilt to assaulting Rihanna, his former girlfriend. Brown's record label also said the music was not \"new.\" Although Brown accepted a plea deal in which he could avoid jail time, any appearance that he is not remorseful could be damaging, since the judge is not bound by those terms when she sentences him in August. The song, which appeared on YouTube, includes the line \"It's not my fault, right?\" The publicist for the Neptunes, a music producing duo that has worked in the studio with Brown, said the music was a demo recorded three years ago. She said they do not know how the song made its way onto YouTube. Jive Records, which distributes Brown's music, said \"there are no 'new' songs from Chris Brown currently being promoted by Chris or his record label.\" \"There are several old demos circulating that are being falsely promoted as new material from Chris,\" a Jive Records statement said. In the song, Brown sings: . \"I picked up the paper and the headline reads, it says 'singer brokenhearted in some satin sheets.' And I'm like, why? We had a hell of a time.\" \"When I first met you, I told ya that you'll be safe. In the midst of arguing something, falls to the floor and breaks. You look down and see what you dropped, oh, it's your heart.\" \"Shortie's caught up from a long night. She's ready to fall but she's all right. That's just something that can happen when you put it down. She's caught up, it's not my fault, right.\" \"You see, her mama called me, really steamed. She said 'My daughter won't eat and she don't sleep. She just cries.' \" Brown was arrested in connection with an altercation that began with an argument with Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street in February. Prosecutors agreed to recommend five years of probation and 180 days of community service for Brown in exchange for his guilty plea on one count of assault with the intent of doing great bodily injury. {task begin}Summarize this article briefly in 3-5 sentences, like 'X did this, Y did that', and wrap your summary with [summary begin] and [summary end] tags{task end}\n\n[summary begin]  \nChris Brown pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna, admitting to an altercation in a Lamborghini in February.

President Obama and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, seen here last month, vow to increase aid. Flanked by Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, the president said his budget calls for a $25 billion increase in funding for the VA over the next five years -- a commitment that will be tested by the needs of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. \"With this budget, we don't just fully fund our Veterans Affairs health care program, we expand it to serve an additional 500,000 veterans by 2013,\" he said. He promised that the VA would \"dramatically improve services\" related to mental health, post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, and he said homeless veterans would be targeted for support. \"Those heroes have a home,\" Obama said. \"It's the country they served, the United States of America, and until we reach a day when not a single veteran sleeps on our nation's streets, our work remains unfinished.\"",

President Obama and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, seen here last month, vow to increase aid. Flanked by Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, the president said his budget calls for a $25 billion increase in funding for the VA over the next five years -- a commitment that will be tested by the needs of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. \"With this budget, we don't just fully fund our Veterans Affairs health care program, we expand it to serve an additional 500,000 veterans by 2013,\" he said. He promised that the VA would \"dramatically improve services\" related to mental health, post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, and he said homeless veterans would be targeted for support. \"Those heroes have a home,\" Obama said. \"It's the country they served, the United States of America, and until we reach a day when not a single veteran sleeps on our nation's streets, our work remains unfinished.\"{task begin}Summarize this article briefly in 3-5 sentences, like 'X did this, Y did that', and wrap your summary with [summary begin] and [summary end] tags{task end}:\n\n[summary begin]  \nPresident Obama pledged to dramatically improve mental health aid for veterans, including better services for PTSD and traumatic brain injury, and committed to serving an additional 500,000 veterans by 2013.

    "article_text": "Two women are just weeks away from giving birth – using transplanted wombs donated by their own mothers. The expectant mums will be the first to carry children using the very uterus that carried them as unborn infants. The pregnancies are part of a revolutionary Swedish project to allow childless women to fulfil their dream of starting a family. The world’s first womb swap baby, named as Vincent, has already been delivered using an unrelated donor. Now doctors are preparing for two more arrivals – but this time each one is being nurtured in its grandmother’s womb. Scroll down for video . World first: Vincent was nurtured in a donated womb.  It has now emerged that two women are just weeks away from giving birth – using transplanted wombs donated by their own mothers . The news gives hope to Britain’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb, Pictured, Vincent and his mother after his delivery . The extraordinary procedure, which doctors have likened in importance to the first successful heart transplant, means each womb will have carried two generations of the same family. Dr Liza Johannesson, of Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, said the pregnancies are going well and the mothers are ‘really excited’ at seeing their babies, which are due next month. ‘It is also really exciting to have your mother as a donor,’ she added. ‘It is a very nice gift to give to your daughter.’ The news gives hope to Britain’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb. Many women will have been born without the organ, others will have had a hysterectomy because of cancer or as a last-ditch attempt stop life-threatening bleeding during labour. Eventually, the technique could also be used on women who have suffered the agony of repeated miscarriages. Using a donated womb also means that expectant mothers can have babies that are genetically their own and experience the joys of pregnancy. Doctors in Turkey and Saudi Arabia have carried out womb transplants before – but none has so far led to a birth. Teams in the US, China and Australia are also keen to start their own programmes. The Swedes have carried out nine womb transplants – and seven of the women have had IVF treatment. Late on Friday night, it emerged that one had been successful – and the world’s first womb transplant baby was delivered. He has been called Vincent – a name derived from the Latin for ‘to conquer’ – to mark the extraordinary lengths his mother undertook to have him. Pernilla Dahm Kähler (left) has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques involved in a womb transplant, said she felt ‘humble and proud’ to witness the birth. Consultant gynaecologist Dr Liza Johannesson (right), of Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, said the pregnancies are going well . (Left to right) Specialist surgeons Andreas G Tzakis, Pernilla Dahm-Kähler, Mats Brannstrom, Michael Olausson and Liza Johannesson attend a news conference, at Sahlgrenska hospital in Gothernburg, Sweden . Born by C-section two months prematurely, Vincent weighed just under 4lb and entered the world with a scream, bringing tears of joy to those who witnessed his arrival. His 36-year-old mother, who worked until the day before he was born, said: ‘As soon as I felt this perfect baby boy on my chest, I had tears of happiness and enormous relief. ‘I felt like a mother the first time I touched my baby and was amazed that we finally did it. ‘I have always had this large sorrow because I never thought I would be a mother – and now the impossible has become real.’ A keen athlete, she was devastated when she was told at the age of 15 that she did not have a womb. She was able to carry her own child after a 61-year-old friend offered to donate her womb. Despite being long past menopause, her womb worked normally during the pregnancy. Consultant gynaecologist Dr Johannesson described Vincent’s birth, which took place a month ago but has remained a secret until now, as ‘breathtaking’. ‘It was like having your own child. It was the same feeling – no one could really believe it.’ The doctor, who was pregnant with her third child at the same time as Vincent’s mother, said: ‘I was more involved in that pregnancy than in my own.’ Vincent is now back home with his parents, who have not been named. He is breastfeeding and growing well. Dr Johannesson added: ‘They are doing perfect. The parents told me that first night at home was horrible because he was screaming – like any other child.’ Vincent’s father said: ‘We now have the most amazing baby. He’s no different from any other child, but he will have a good story to tell.’ Mats Brannstrom and his team performing a womb transplant in Gothenburg, Sweden . The first British transplants could be carried out as soon as next summer – using wombs from dead donors. Richard Smith, head of the charity Womb Transplant UK, is ready to give five women the chance to have children using the procedure and is applying for ethical approval. Some 60 potential patients have already come forward. But Mr Smith, who has already spent significant amounts of his own money on years of research, only has £40,000 of the £500,000 needed for the surgery. Unlike the Swedish project in which living donors are used, the consultant gynaecological surgeon plans to use wombs from women who have died young. He said he is uncomfortable about removing a woman’s womb for an operation that is not essential to save a life. He claims taking the organ from a dead donor will allow him to harvest extra tissue and the major blood vessels needed to take the strain of pregnancy. One of his potential patients, Sophie Lewis, said: ‘To feel your own child growing inside you would be a miracle.’ The 30-year-old, who said she burst into tears of joy when she heard of Vincent’s birth in Sweden, added. ‘It would be an absolute gift, the most amazing gift ever.’ Mr Smith added: ‘In many women, there is a deep yearning to carry children and this is not fulfilled by surrogacy. ‘I’ve had my own crisis with this project over the years – are we doing the right thing? ‘But when you meet women in this position, I know in my heart of hearts that if we do it safely, it is the right thing.’ Henrik Hagberg, a professor in foetal medicine at King’s College London, who did ultrasound scans of Vincent throughout the pregnancy, said: ‘I was quite astounded that everything went so well. I think that’s quite fantastic.’ Pernilla Dahm Kähler, who along with Mats Brännström of Gothenburg University has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques involved in a womb transplant, said she felt ‘humble and proud’ to witness the birth. Dr Dahm Kähler helped remove the donor womb from the 61-year-old woman – and transplant it in Vincent’s mother. Professor Brännström said the birth provides scientific evidence that the technique works, adding: ‘It gives us scientific evidence that the concept of uterus transplantation can be used to treat uterine factor infertility, which up to now has remained the last untreatable form of female infertility. ‘It also shows that transplants with a live donor are possible, including if the donor is past menopause.’ Dr Allan Pacey, chairman of the British Fertility Society, likened the operations to the first heart transplant. He added: ‘I think it is quite revolutionary. It feels like it did when IVF was developed or when the first heart transplant was done in the 1960s. ‘It is a bit of a game-changer. The question is can it be done repeatedly, reliably and safely.’ Dr Geeta Nargund, medical director of the Create fertility clinic in London, said: ‘This is a significant medical breakthrough and I congratulate the highly-skilled team behind it.’ However, she said the complexity of the surgery means it will be restricted to a few specialist hospitals.",

The expectant mums will be the first to carry children using the very uterus that carried them as unborn infants. The pregnancies are part of a revolutionary Swedish project to allow childless women to fulfil their dream of starting a family. The world’s first womb swap baby, named as Vincent, has already been delivered using an unrelated donor. Now doctors are preparing for two more arrivals – but this time each one is being nurtured in its grandmother’s womb. Scroll down for video . World first: Vincent was nurtured in a donated womb.  It has now emerged that two women are just weeks away from giving birth – using transplanted wombs donated by their own mothers . The news gives hope to Britain’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb, Pictured, Vincent and his mother after his delivery . The extraordinary procedure, which doctors have likened in importance to the first successful heart transplant, means each womb will have carried two generations of the same family. Dr Liza Johannesson, of Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, said the pregnancies are going well and the mothers are ‘really excited’ at seeing their babies, which are due next month. ‘It is also really exciting to have your mother as a donor,’ she added. ‘It is a very nice gift to give to your daughter.’ The news gives hope to Britain’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb. Many women will have been born without the organ, others will have had a hysterectomy because of cancer or as a last-ditch attempt stop life-threatening bleeding during labour. Eventually, the technique could also be used on women who have suffered the agony of repeated miscarriages. Using a donated womb also means that expectant mothers can have babies that are genetically their own and experience the joys of pregnancy. Doctors in Turkey and Saudi Arabia have carried out womb transplants before – but none has so far led to a birth. Teams in the US, China and Australia are also keen to start their own programmes. The Swedes have carried out nine womb transplants – and seven of the women have had IVF treatment. Late on Friday night, it emerged that one had been successful – and the world’s first womb transplant baby was delivered. He has been called Vincent – a name derived from the Latin for ‘to conquer’ – to mark the extraordinary lengths his mother undertook to have him. Pernilla Dahm Kähler (left) has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques involved in a womb transplant, said she felt ‘humble and proud’ to witness the birth. Consultant gynaecologist Dr Liza Johannesson (right), of Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, said the pregnancies are going well . (Left to right) Specialist surgeons Andreas G Tzakis, Pernilla Dahm-Kähler, Mats Brannstrom, Michael Olausson and Liza Johannesson attend a news conference, at Sahlgrenska hospital in Gothernburg, Sweden . Born by C-section two months prematurely, Vincent weighed just under 4lb and entered the world with a scream, bringing tears of joy to those who witnessed his arrival. His 36-year-old mother, who worked until the day before he was born, said: ‘As soon as I felt this perfect baby boy on my chest, I had tears of happiness and enormous relief. ‘I felt like a mother the first time I touched my baby and was amazed that we finally did it. ‘I have always had this large sorrow because I never thought I would be a mother – and now the impossible has become real.’ A keen athlete, she was devastated when she was told at the age of 15 that she did not have a womb. She was able to carry her own child after a 61-year-old friend offered to donate her womb. Despite being long past menopause, her womb worked normally during the pregnancy. Consultant gynaecologist Dr Johannesson described Vincent’s birth, which took place a month ago but has remained a secret until now, as ‘breathtaking’. ‘It was like having your own child. It was the same feeling – no one could really believe it.’ The doctor, who was pregnant with her third child at the same time as Vincent’s mother, said: ‘I was more involved in that pregnancy than in my own.’ Vincent is now back home with his parents, who have not been named. He is breastfeeding and growing well. Dr Johannesson added: ‘They are doing perfect. The parents told me that first night at home was horrible because he was screaming – like any other child.’ Vincent’s father said: ‘We now have the most amazing baby. He’s no different from any other child, but he will have a good story to tell.’ Mats Brannstrom and his team performing a womb transplant in Gothenburg, Sweden . The first British transplants could be carried out as soon as next summer – using wombs from dead donors. Richard Smith, head of the charity Womb Transplant UK, is ready to give five women the chance to have children using the procedure and is applying for ethical approval. Some 60 potential patients have already come forward. But Mr Smith, who has already spent significant amounts of his own money on years of research, only has £40,000 of the £500,000 needed for the surgery. Unlike the Swedish project in which living donors are used, the consultant gynaecological surgeon plans to use wombs from women who have died young. He said he is uncomfortable about removing a woman’s womb for an operation that is not essential to save a life. He claims taking the organ from a dead donor will allow him to harvest extra tissue and the major blood vessels needed to take the strain of pregnancy. One of his potential patients, Sophie Lewis, said: ‘To feel your own child growing inside you would be a miracle.’ The 30-year-old, who said she burst into tears of joy when she heard of Vincent’s birth in Sweden, added. ‘It would be an absolute gift, the most amazing gift ever.’ Mr Smith added: ‘In many women, there is a deep yearning to carry children and this is not fulfilled by surrogacy. ‘I’ve had my own crisis with this project over the years – are we doing the right thing? ‘But when you meet women in this position, I know in my heart of hearts that if we do it safely, it is the right thing.’ Henrik Hagberg, a professor in foetal medicine at King’s College London, who did ultrasound scans of Vincent throughout the pregnancy, said: ‘I was quite astounded that everything went so well. I think that’s quite fantastic.’ Pernilla Dahm Kähler, who along with Mats Brännström of Gothenburg University has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques involved in a womb transplant, said she felt ‘humble and proud’ to witness the birth. Dr Dahm Kähler helped remove the donor womb from the 61-year-old woman – and transplant it in Vincent’s mother. Professor Brännström said the birth provides scientific evidence that the technique works, adding: ‘It gives us scientific evidence that the concept of uterus transplantation can be used to treat uterine factor infertility, which up to now has remained the last untreatable form of female infertility. ‘It also shows that transplants with a live donor are possible, including if the donor is past menopause.’ Dr Allan Pacey, chairman of the British Fertility Society, likened the operations to the first heart transplant. He added: ‘I think it is quite revolutionary. It feels like it did when IVF was developed or when the first heart transplant was done in the 1960s. ‘It is a bit of a game-changer. The question is can it be done repeatedly, reliably and safely.’ Dr Geeta Nargund, medical director of the Create fertility clinic in London, said: ‘This is a significant medical breakthrough and I congratulate the highly-skilled team behind it.’ However, she said the complexity of the surgery means it will be restricted to a few specialist hospitals. Dr Johannesson said the pregnancies are going well and the mothers are ‘really excited’ at seeing their babies, which are due next month. ‘It is also really exciting to have your mother as a donor,’ she added. ‘It is a very nice gift to give to your daughter.’ The news gives hope to Britain’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb.

    "article_text": "More than a decade after concluding a fuel tank explosion destroyed TWA Flight 800, senior U.S. accident investigators stood their ground on Tuesday against skeptics claiming new evidence suggests missile fire downed the jumbo jet. \"I'm totally convinced there was no bomb or missile,\" National Transportation Safety Board investigator Jim Wildey told reporters at a briefing outside Washington. Skeptics, including a former NTSB investigator, last month petitioned the agency to re-open its investigation and will release a documentary on the crash this month. Conspiracy theories, outrage swirl around TWA 800 plane . They said evidence suggests one or more missiles destroyed the Paris-bound Boeing 747 over the Atlantic shortly after takeoff from New York on July 17, 1996, killing all 230 on board. The safety board has responded cautiously, saying it is having investigators who were not part of the original investigation review the petition. And it is seeking comment from Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration, and other parties to the original probe. But at the same time, the board allowed the original TWA 800 investigators to brief the media on the four-year investigation. Under orders to address only matters in the original investigation, the investigators nonetheless emphasized topics that have come under question by the critics. They held up two sheet metal plates showing examples of bomb and high-velocity missile damage, and then took reporters to view TWA 800's reconstructed fuselage. They said they found no pitting of the type alleged by those challenging the findings. \"You don't see fragmented seat parts,\" said investigator Robert Swaim. Nor is there evidence of pitting, cratering or \"gas jetting\" -- tell-tale marks left by high explosives -- he said. Plane reconstructed . Investigators said they were unable to find any evidence on radar of a missile intercepting the plane. And they discounted the significance of traces of explosives found on more than 100 airplane parts pulled from the ocean. The NTSB said tests showed that explosive residue washes off after only two days in the ocean, leading them to conclude the residue likely was the result of contamination from the military and law enforcement boats that recovered wreckage. The NTSB allowed two TWA 800 family members to attend the briefing, and the family members reiterated their support for the board's findings. Matt Ziemkiewicz, whose sister Jill, a 23-year-old flight attendant, was killed in the explosion, said the briefing \"solidified\" his belief that the original investigation was \"complete, accurate and thorough.\" Jim Hurd, whose son Jamie, 29, died on the flight, also endorsed the NTSB finding. \"At first I was of course skeptical as everybody else. You know, you just didn't know what happened. As things unfolded, it seemed to make a lot of sense, what happened to the plane,\" he said. \"It's really cut and dry, at this point, as far as I'm concerned.\" Ziemkiewicz and Hurd said the new attention to the crash is opening old wounds. \"It's really a shame in my book,\" Hurd said. \"There are still family members who believe it was brought down by a bomb and I respect their thoughts and however they want to view it. It's just the way you take the information and how you process it and who you believe. And I believe the NTSB has done a job and I don't believe they've covered up anything and I don't believe the FBI did either.\" The NTSB did not allow their critics into the media briefing. They talked to reporters in a parking lot outside. Opinion: Flight 800 conspiracy? Where's the proof? 'A matter of conscience' Hank Hughes, a former NTSB investigator who now doubts the board's conclusion, said he is motivated only by a desire to uncover the truth. Hughes said following the accident, he spent two days with Hurd. \"That's the last guy in the world I'd want to hurt,\" he said. \"There's no profit motive. It's a matter of conscience and integrity as far as we're concerned. Two hundred and thirty people were killed and that's a tragedy that can't be ignored,\" Hughes said. Hughes is featured in the documentary, called \"TWA Flight 800,\" co-produced by longtime skeptic Tom Stalcup. The NTSB investigators on Tuesday repeated a scenario the safety board endorsed in 2000. The series of events leading to TWA 800's disastrous final flight began when it was delayed at New York's John F. Kennedy airport. While the plane was sitting at the gate, the crew engaged the plane's air conditioner to keep passengers cool. The air conditioning units, low in the plane's fuselage, heated the large, nearly empty fuel tank above it, creating a volatile fuel/air mixture. Ten minutes after take-off, when the plane was at 13,700 feet and climbing, an electrical short that likely occurred in a wire bundle pushed a high-voltage current into the fuel tank, igniting it, and destroying the plane. Divers found three overlapping fields of debris at the bottom of the ocean. The first included the pieces of the fuel tank and the cabin above it. A second field contained the nose and cockpit. The final and largest debris field contained the rest of the plane. Investigators said they worked hard to determine if a bomb or missile was involved, especially in light of the event's timing two days before the Summer Olympics and 10 days before the Olympic bombing in Atlanta. \"That really intensified the investigation,\" said investigator Joseph Kolly. A cockpit voice recorder analysis showed a sound spectrum consistent with a low-explosive fuel tank explosion, not a high-explosive missile. Eventually, investigators ruled out a missile or bomb, as well as lightning, meteor, electro-magnetic pulse, and other possible causes, Kolly said. Kolly acknowledged some friction between the NTSB and the FBI during the investigation, but said \"it didn't ultimately harm the investigation.\" Kolly said the petition has not prompted him to rethink the board's 2000 findings. Since the petition was filed, Kolly said, he has re-read this report \"a couple more times and it's pretty thorough.\" Five facts to calm plane crash fears .",

Skeptics, including a former NTSB investigator, last month petitioned the agency to re-open its investigation and will release a documentary on the crash this month. Conspiracy theories, outrage swirl around TWA 800 plane . They said evidence suggests one or more missiles destroyed the Paris-bound Boeing 747 over the Atlantic shortly after takeoff from New York on July 17, 1996, killing all 230 on board. The safety board has responded cautiously, saying it is having investigators who were not part of the original investigation review the petition. And it is seeking comment from Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration, and other parties to the original probe. But at the same time, the board allowed the original TWA 800 investigators to brief the media on the four-year investigation. Under orders to address only matters in the original investigation, the investigators nonetheless emphasized topics that have come under question by the critics. They held up two sheet metal plates showing examples of bomb and high-velocity missile damage, and then took reporters to view TWA 800's reconstructed fuselage. They said they found no pitting of the type alleged by those challenging the findings. \"You don't see fragmented seat parts,\" said investigator Robert Swaim. Nor is there evidence of pitting, cratering or \"gas jetting\" -- tell-tale marks left by high explosives -- he said. Plane reconstructed . Investigators said they were unable to find any evidence on radar of a missile intercepting the plane. And they discounted the significance of traces of explosives found on more than 100 airplane parts pulled from the ocean. The NTSB said tests showed that explosive residue washes off after only two days in the ocean, leading them to conclude the residue likely was the result of contamination from the military and law enforcement boats that recovered wreckage. The NTSB allowed two TWA 800 family members to attend the briefing, and the family members reiterated their support for the board's findings. Matt Ziemkiewicz, whose sister Jill, a 23-year-old flight attendant, was killed in the explosion, said the briefing \"solidified\" his belief that the original investigation was \"complete, accurate and thorough.\" Jim Hurd, whose son Jamie, 29, died on the flight, also endorsed the NTSB finding. \"At first I was of course skeptical as everybody else. You know, you just didn't know what happened. As things unfolded, it seemed to make a lot of sense, what happened to the plane,\" he said. \"It's really cut and dry, at this point, as far as I'm concerned.\" Ziemkiewicz and Hurd said the new attention to the crash is opening old wounds. \"It's really a shame in my book,\" Hurd said. \"There are still family members who believe it was brought down by a bomb and I respect their thoughts and however they want to view it. It's just the way you take the information and how you process it and who you believe. And I believe the NTSB has done a job and I don't believe they've covered up anything and I don't believe the FBI did either.\" The NTSB did not allow their critics into the media briefing. They talked to reporters in a parking lot outside. Opinion: Flight 800 conspiracy? Where's the proof? 'A matter of conscience' Hank Hughes, a former NTSB investigator who now doubts the board's conclusion, said he is motivated only by a desire to uncover the truth. Hughes said following the accident, he spent two days with Hurd. \"That's the last guy in the world I'd want to hurt,\" he said. \"There's no profit motive. It's a matter of conscience and integrity as far as we're concerned. Two hundred and thirty people were killed and that's a tragedy that can't be ignored,\" Hughes said. Hughes is featured in the documentary, called \"TWA Flight 800,\" co-produced by longtime skeptic Tom Stalcup. The NTSB investigators on Tuesday repeated a scenario the safety board endorsed in 2000. The series of events leading to TWA 800's disastrous final flight began when it was delayed at New York's John F. Kennedy airport. While the plane was sitting at the gate, the crew engaged the plane's air conditioner to keep passengers cool. The air conditioning units, low in the plane's fuselage, heated the large, nearly empty fuel tank above it, creating a volatile fuel/air mixture. Ten minutes after take-off, when the plane was at 13,700 feet and climbing, an electrical short that likely occurred in a wire bundle pushed a high-voltage current into the fuel tank, igniting it, and destroying the plane. Divers found three overlapping fields of debris at the bottom of the ocean. The first included the pieces of the fuel tank and the cabin above it. A second field contained the nose and cockpit. The final and largest debris field contained the rest of the plane. Investigators said they worked hard to determine if a bomb or missile was involved, especially in light of the event's timing two days before the Summer Olympics and 10 days before the Olympic bombing in Atlanta. \"That really intensified the investigation,\" said investigator Joseph Kolly. A cockpit voice recorder analysis showed a sound spectrum consistent with a low-explosive fuel tank explosion, not a high-explosive missile. Eventually, investigators ruled out a missile or bomb, as well as lightning, meteor, electro-magnetic pulse, and other possible causes, Kolly said. Kolly acknowledged some friction between the NTSB and the FBI during the investigation, but said \"it didn't ultimately harm the investigation.\" Kolly said the petition has not prompted him to rethink the board's 2000 findings. Since the petition was filed, Kolly said, he has re-read this report \"a couple more times and it's pretty thorough.\" Five facts to calm plane crash fears . The NTSB has now released the complete text of its 2000 report on TWA 800. The report states that the plane's fuel tank likely overheated due to air conditioning, which ignited the fuel-air mixture in the tank. The explosion caused the plane to break apart, killing all 230 on board. Investigators found no signs of a missile or bomb in the wreckage. The NTSB has ruled out lightning, meteor, and electromagnetic pulse as possible causes. The NTSB has confirmed that the cockpit voice recorder data supports a fuel tank explosion, not a missile blast.\n\n[summary begin]\nSenior U.S. accident investigators from the NTSB insisted there was no bomb or missile involved in the 1996 TWA Flight 800 crash, emphasizing the lack of pitting, cratering, or gas jetting in the wreckage and citing cockpit voice recorder data consistent with a fuel tank explosion. They held up sheet metal plates showing damage from bombs and missiles, and reviewed the reconstructed fuselage to refute claims of high-explosive impact. The NTSB noted that no radar signals showed a missile intercepting the plane and that explosive residue on debris likely came from military or law enforcement vessels, not a bomb. Critics, including former NTSB investigator Hank Hughes and a documentary producer, have pushed for a re-investigation, but the board maintains its 2000 findings are thorough and accurate, with some family members reaffirming their belief in the original conclusion.

It also burns more calories, as skiers glide along snowy trails and skate up inclines. Trail passes at Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area are $21 for adults -- but ask about specials. So, for those of you trying to stay true to your 2009 resolutions, the sport may be the perfect way to get more exercise and take in a dose of nature in the process. CNN asked Ron Bergin, publisher of Cross Country Skier magazine, to recommend five places to hit the horizontal slopes. Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area, Lake Tahoe, California . The area around Lake Tahoe, which straddles the border between California and Nevada, is ripe with cross-country skiing opportunities. So much so, said Kevin Murnane, general manager of the Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area, that \"you can spend a whole week here and ski at a different area every day.\" Bergin said the lakeside scenery is top-notch, as is the skier culture. You likely will find buddies who will share trail stories and a drink after a long day on the trails. Murnane's ski area allows dogs on some trails and offers free lessons to help learners adjust to the balance-intensive sport. Trail passes at Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area are $21 for adults, but ask about specials. On Tuesdays, passes run $12. Groups and early-morning skiers also get a discount. Trapp Family Lodge, Stowe, Vermont . Owned by descendants of Maria von Trapp -- yes, that Trapp family, whose life inspired \"The Sound of Music\" -- the Trapp Family Lodge brings a little piece of Austria's lively hills to the mountains of Vermont. Johannes von Trapp, the real Maria's youngest son, helped open the lodge in 1968. The family had been in the lodging business before the musical film starring Julie Andrews debuted in 1965. For Bergin, the history itself is a draw. So is the fact that the luxury lodge, which still pulls off a quaint charm, is dedicated to cross-country skiing. \"It's beautiful. It backs up to the mountains and you've got a great view of a lot of trails,\" Bergin said. The lodge offers a range of promotions, from wine-and-dine packages to those geared toward \"winter wellness.\" The lodge offers rooms and chalets ranging from $275 to $475 per night. Go for the two-night package and you'll get ski rentals, breakfast, dinner and lodging for both days for $500 per person. Methow Valley, Winthrop, Washington . Northeast of Seattle in the Cascade Mountains, nearly 125 miles of ski trails connect the villages of Methow Valley. It's almost as if cross-country skiing becomes a form of transportation in and around the area, Bergin said. While the linear path is \"not a typical layout\" compared to most cross-country loops, Bergin said the trails offer a sense of adventure and exploration. At one end, you'll find The Sun Mountain Lodge, which is the area's luxurious gem. But the valley also has hangouts for the Bohemian traveler: The Old Schoolhouse Brewery sells $4 pints in a smart red building and the local food cooperative offers organic smoothies and sandwiches. Trail passes run $20 for adults and $10 for teens ages 13 to 17. Stokely Creek Lodge, Goulais River, Ontario, Canada . Located in Ontario, Canada, north of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, this remote lodge gives skiers a serene escape from the bustle of everyday life. \"You ski away from the lodge and immediately you feel like you're out in the wilderness,\" Bergin said. \"All of a sudden, you're just transported from the day-to-day.\" The natural scenery -- more than 12 square miles of it -- is varied and always exciting, he said. Around some curves, skiers will find a cold creek. Other areas are known for hills or lakes that seem like they're in the middle of nowhere. The lodge offers $15 day passes for groups of ten or more; kids 18 and younger pay $10 and adult passes are $18. For the full treatment, though, two adults can stay the night at rates ranging from $98 to $170. That includes two ski passes and three meals, which, according to lodge manager Jamie Martin, are almost as big a hit as the skiing. The kitchen serves highbrow treats like filet mignon and Cornish hen, he said. Cable Area, Cable, Wisconsin . Northern Wisconsin is proof that you don't need huge mountains for good skiing. The Cable Area -- which includes the towns of Cable, Drummond, Namakagon and Grand View -- boasts one of the world's biggest cross-country ski races and is regarded by some as the birthplace for the sport in North America, Bergin said. Bergin, who lives in the area, called the Cable Area the \"Mecca\" for cross-country skiing in the region. \"Within the radius of an hour's drive, you could probably find 30 or 40 trail systems of all sizes and shapes,\" he said. \"There's quite a skiing culture.\" The Telemark Resort offers trail passes that are cheaper than most: $11 per day. Lodging at the resort ranges from $79 for a room in the lodge to $275 for a 1,000-square-foot condo, said Darrell Buchmann, the resort's general manager.",

It also burns more calories, as skiers glide along snowy trails and skate up inclines. Trail passes at Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area are $21 for adults -- but ask about specials. So, for those of you trying to stay true to your 2009 resolutions, the sport may be the perfect way to get more exercise and take in a dose of nature in the process. CNN asked Ron Bergin, publisher of Cross Country Skier magazine, to recommend five places to hit the horizontal slopes. Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area, Lake Tahoe, California . The area around Lake Tahoe, which straddles the border between California and Nevada, is ripe with cross-country skiing opportunities. So much so, said Kevin Murnane, general manager of the Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area, that \"you can spend a whole week here and ski at a different area every day.\" Bergin said the lakeside scenery is top-notch, as is the skier culture. You likely will find buddies who will share trail stories and a drink after a long day on the trails. Murnane's ski area allows dogs on some trails and offers free lessons to help learners adjust to the balance-intensive sport.

But the valley also has hangouts for the Bohemian traveler: The Old Schoolhouse Brewery sells $4 pints in a smart red building and the local food cooperative offers organic smoothies and sandwiches. Trail passes run $20 for adults and $10 for teens ages 13 to 17. Stokely Creek Lodge, Goulais River, Ontario, Canada . Located in Ontario, Canada, north of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, this remote lodge gives skiers a serene escape from the bustle of everyday life. \"You ski away from the lodge and immediately you feel like you're out in the wilderness,\" Bergin said. \"All of a sudden, you're just transported from the day-to-day.\" The natural scenery -- more than 12 square miles of it -- is varied and always exciting, he said.

The lodge offers $15 day passes for groups of ten or more; kids 18 and younger pay $10 and adult passes are $18. For the full treatment, though, two adults can stay the night at rates ranging from $98 to $170. That includes two ski passes and three meals, which, according to lodge manager Jamie Martin, are almost as big a hit as the skiing. The kitchen serves highbrow treats like filet mignon and Cornish hen, he said. Cable Area, Cable, Wisconsin . Northern Wisconsin is proof that you don't need huge mountains for good skiing. The Cable Area -- which includes the towns of Cable, Drummond, Namakagon and Grand View -- boasts one of the world's biggest cross-country ski races and is regarded by some as the birthplace for the sport in North America, Bergin said. Bergin, who lives in the area, called the Cable Area the \"Mecca\" for cross-country skiing in the region. \"Within the radius of an hour's drive, you could probably find 30 or 40 trail systems of all sizes and shapes,\" he said. \"There's quite a skiing culture.\" The Telemark Resort offers trail passes that are cheaper than most: $11 per day. Lodging at the resort ranges from $79 for a room in the lodge to $275 for a 1,000-square-foot condo, said Darrell Buchmann, the resort's general manager. For those with a longer interest in skiing, the area also offers a full range of rentals and ski schools. In all, Bergin recommends these five places for cross-country skiing in North America. The article highlights five cross-country skiing destinations across North America: Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area in California offers scenic trails, dog-friendly paths, and discounted passes (e.g., $12 on Tuesdays), with group and early-morning rates; Trapp Family Lodge in Vermont combines Austrian heritage with cross-country skiing, offering wine-and-dine packages and lodging at $275–$475 per night; Methow Valley in Washington features nearly 125 miles of trails, with affordable passes ($20 for adults, $10 for teens), and local hangouts like a brewery and food cooperative; Stokely Creek Lodge in Ontario, Canada, provides a remote, wilderness experience with scenic lakes and creeks, offering group and youth passes and overnight stays at $98–$170 with three meals included; and the Cable Area in Wisconsin, known as a mecca for cross-country skiing, has affordable daily passes ($11), diverse trail systems, and extensive rental and school options.

    "article_text": "Risk: Eloise Coulson, pictured with her convicted husband, could lose the property in Preston Kent . For eight months she has endured the humiliation of her husband’s disgrace and revelations about his affair with Rebekah Brooks. Now Eloise Coulson could face losing her family’s home as the prosecution seek to recoup almost £750,000 in costs for the phone hacking trial. The Crown Prosecution Service spent £1.7million bringing Andy Coulson, Mrs Brooks and four others to trial. Coulson, 46, is hoping to force his former employers in the Rupert Murdoch media empire to pay his share but if he fails the CPS has said it would look to his ‘assets’ to recover its costs. It is understood they could include his family home in Preston, Kent, which he shares with his wife and three young sons. The couple have already sold their £1.5million five-bedroom Victorian home in Forest Hill, South London, after he was charged, and downsized to a £600,000 house near Canterbury. Mrs Coulson, 42, accompanied Coulson to court regularly during the eight-month trial but has not been seen at his side at the Old Bailey since his conviction last week. Coulson – who earned a reported £475,000-a-year as the Conservatives’ director of communications – is also facing a retrial on allegations he made corrupt payments to public officials. He and Mrs Brooks began an affair in 1998 and admitted it had been rekindled at least twice after his marriage to PR consultant Eloise in 2000. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said: ‘Mr Coulson has a number of assets which have a financial value. One of them is an indemnity.’ Coulson’s ‘indemnity’ from his ex-employers News International, now News UK, means the firm has been forced to pay his legal bills. He took them to court in August 2011 after they stopped the payments and he successfully argued they had a legal duty to continue to cover his legal fees. It is not clear if the firm will have to cover his share of the CPS costs, or any ongoing legal fees. Costs are due to be decided in a two-day hearing later this month. Case: Coulson - who earned a reported £475,000-a-year as the Conservatives’ director of communications - is also facing a retrial on allegations he made corrupt payments to public officials . So far, only news editor James Weatherup has been ordered to pay a £5,000 share of prosecution costs. A legal source said it would be unusual for a family home to be seized to cover CPS costs, but said the cost of the trial was unusually high. Meanwhile, Mrs Brooks, her husband Charlie, her former assistant Cheryl Carter, former News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner and News International security chief Mark Hanna have all asked for their defence costs to be paid by public funds after they were all acquitted.

For eight months she has endured the humiliation of her husband’s disgrace and revelations about his affair with Rebekah Brooks. Now Eloise Coulson could face losing her family’s home as the prosecution seek to recoup almost £750,000 in costs for the phone hacking trial. The Crown Prosecution Service spent £1.7million bringing Andy Coulson, Mrs Brooks and four others to trial. Coulson, 46, is hoping to force his former employers in the Rupert Murdoch media empire to pay his share but if he fails the CPS has said it would look to his ‘assets’ to recover its costs. It is understood they could include his family home in Preston, Kent, which he shares with his wife and three young sons. The couple have already sold their £1.5million five-bedroom Victorian home in Forest Hill, South London, after he was charged, and downsized to a £600,000 house near Canterbury. Mrs Coulson, 42, accompanied Coulson to court regularly during the eight-month trial but has not been seen at his side at the Old Bailey since his conviction last week. Coulson – who earned a reported £475,000-a-year as the Conservatives’ director of communications – is also facing a retrial on allegations he made corrupt payments to public officials. He and Mrs Brooks began an affair in 1998 and admitted it had been rekindled at least twice after his marriage to PR consultant Eloise in 2000. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said: ‘Mr Coulson has a number of assets which have a financial value. One of them is an indemnity.’ Coulson’s ‘indemnity’ from his ex-employers News International, now News UK, means the firm has been forced to pay his legal bills. He took them to court in August 2011 after they stopped the payments and he successfully argued they had a legal duty to continue to cover his legal fees. It is not clear if the firm will have to cover his share of the CPS costs, or any ongoing legal fees. Costs are due to be decided in a two-day hearing later this month. Case: Coulson - who earned a reported £475,000-a-year as the Conservatives’ director of communications - is also facing a retrial on allegations he made corrupt payments to public officials . So far, only news editor James Weatherup has been ordered to pay a £5,000 share of prosecution costs. A legal source said it would be unusual for a family home to be seized to cover CPS costs, but said the cost of the trial was unusually high. Meanwhile, Mrs Brooks, her husband Charlie, her former assistant Cheryl Carter, former News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner and News International security chief Mark Hanna have all asked for their defence costs to be paid by public funds after they were all acquitted.
