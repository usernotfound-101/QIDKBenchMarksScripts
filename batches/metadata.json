    "topic": "Many machine models different from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature, for example random access machines. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary. What all these models have in common is that the machines operate deterministically.",

      "What commonality do alternate machine models, such as random access machines, share with Turing machines?",

      "What two resources commonly consumed by alternate models are typically known to vary?"
