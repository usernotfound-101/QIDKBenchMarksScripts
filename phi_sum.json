    "generated_summary": "Olivia de Havilland is deeply mourning her sister Joan Fontaine, reflecting on their tumultuous childhood filled with rivalry and constant feuds. Despite being equally talented and nominated for Oscars, their personal animosity kept them apart in their acting careers, with Fontaine winning in 1941 and De Havilland following in 1947 and later in 2010. Their likeness and a competitive mother may have intensified their discord. Following Joan's death, Olivia is overwhelmed by the sympathy and kind messages she receives.",

Hollywood legend Olivia de Havilland was today 'in mourning' over the death of her equally famous sister Joan Fontaine . Hollywood legend Olivia de Havilland was today ‘in mourning’ over the death of her equally famous sister Joan Fontaine, telling friends: ‘I’ll never forget her’. The Oscar-winning actress is now almost 97, and living in an upmarket apartment block close to the Arc de Triumphe in Paris. She and her sister were notorious for their bitter quarrels, and barely spent any time together during their long and successful screen careers. But on Monday Ms De Havilland issued a statement saying she was ‘shocked and saddened’ by Joan’s death on Sunday at the age of 96. ‘Joan was her kid sister – of course she’s hugely sad at her passing,’ said one of Ms De Havilland’s friends in the French capital. ‘She’s certainly in mourning and has made it clear that she will never forget Joan.’ Olivia has been bombarded with flowers and letters since Sunday night, and said in her statement that she was overwhelmed by ‘the many kind expressions of sympathies.’ Ms De Havilland and Ms Fontaine, who lived in California at the time of her death, were among Hollywood's most famous sisters. Both were nominated for the best actress Oscar in 1941, and Ms Fontaine won it for her role in the film ‘Suspicion’. Scroll down for video . Long feud: Sisters Olivia De Havilland and Joan Fontaine were born just 15 months apart . Recalling the awards ceremony many years . later, Ms Fontaine said: ‘All the animus we'd felt toward each other as . children, the hair pullings, the savage wrestling matches, the time . Olivia fractured my collarbone, all came rushing back in kaleidoscopic . imagery. ‘My paralysis was total. I felt Olivia would spring across the table and grab me by the hair. Left to right: Fontaine opposite Laurence Olivier in Rebecca (he had wanted the part of the second Mrs de Winter to go to his real life soon-to-be wife, Vivien Leigh); and with Orson Welles in Jane Eyre . 'I felt age 4, being confronted by my older sister. Damn it, I'd incurred her wrath again!’ Ms . De Havilland is hugely respected in France, and was awarded the Legion . of Honour by the then President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2010. She won two Oscars in all, including one for her part in in the 1947 film ‘To Each His Own’. Joan Fontaine (left) said the sibling rivalry was encouraged by their ambitious stage mother. It may have also had something to do with their similarity (the photo on the right, for example, is of Olivia de Havilland) Olivia de Havilland pictured with  Frederic Mitterrand at the 36th Cesar French Film Awards in Paris in 2011 . When . Fontaine tried to congratulate her for the 1947 award, Ms De Havilland . ignored her, with a spokesman saying: ‘This goes back for years and . years, ever since they were children.’ Ms . Fontaine once told The Hollywood Reporter: ‘I married first, won the .

Despite their Oscar nominations and shared fame, they rarely spent time together due to ongoing feuds. Both received honors in their acting careers, with Fontaine winning the 1941 Oscar and De Havilland achieving Oscars in 1947 and 2010. Their family dynamic was further complicated by their similar appearances and an ambitious mother who may have fueled their rivalry. Ms De Havilland receives an outpouring of sympathy after Joan's death.\nSummary end\n- Output: [summary begin] Olivia de Havilland is deeply mourning her sister Joan Fontaine, reflecting on their tumultuous childhood filled with rivalry and constant feuds. Despite being equally talented and nominated for Oscars, their personal animosity kept them apart in their acting careers, with Fontaine winning in 1941 and De Havilland following in 1947 and later in 2010. Their likeness and a competitive mother may have intensified their discord. Following Joan's death, Olivia is overwhelmed by the sympathy and kind messages she receives.

Europe minister David Lidington has become the latest senior figure to land a blow against the High Speed 2 rail link. The Tory MP, whose Aylesbury constituency in Buckinghamshire will be affected by the line, joined the chorus of opposition to HS2 – though as a minister he is duty bound to back the scheme. He raised fears over the spiralling cost – now at £42.6billion – and noise of the trains. In a letter to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Mr Lidington came close to calling for the project to be scrapped after its budget soared by £10 billion. Objections: Europe minister David Lidington is worried about the spiralling cost of the HS2 project . He wrote that constituents had told him this rise ‘gives them no confidence that the final figure will [not] be significantly higher and in the current economic climate that cannot be justified’. Voters believed HS2 should be cancelled and the money spent on other infrastructure projects, he added. Mr Lidington also cast doubt on the level of noise those living along the HS2 line would have to endure. In a letter to Alison Munro, HS2’s chief executive, he said the study measuring average noise levels had included the period between midnight and 5am, when no trains run. This had led to ‘very serious underestimates of what my constituents are likely to experience between 11pm and midnight and 5am and 7am’, he said. Mr Lidington has been criticised by some constituents for not backing a rebel attempt to scupper paving legislation for HS2. High speed: Mr Lidington is also worried about late night and early morning noise from the line affecting his Buckinghamshire constituents . But he made clear resigning was a ‘nuclear’ option. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is said to be ‘not a fan’ of the project and former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan has labelled the scheme a ‘boys’ toy’. The Government insists HS2 will boost the economy in the North and that scrapping it would cost close to 100,000 jobs.

Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 18:53 EST, 7 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:53 EST, 7 July 2013 . Europe minister David Lidington has become the latest senior figure to land a blow against the High Speed 2 rail link. The Tory MP, whose Aylesbury constituency in Buckinghamshire will be affected by the line, joined the chorus of opposition to HS2 – though as a minister he is duty bound to back the scheme. He raised fears over the spiralling cost – now at £42.6billion – and noise of the trains. In a letter to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Mr Lidington came close to calling for the project to be scrapped after its budget soared by £10 billion. Objections: Europe minister David Lidington is worried about the spiralling cost of the HS2 project . He wrote that constituents had told him this rise ‘gives them no confidence that the final figure will [not] be significantly higher and in the current economic climate that cannot be justified’. Voters believed HS2 should be cancelled and the money spent on other infrastructure projects, he added. Mr Lidington also cast doubt on the level of noise those living along the HS2 line would have to endure. In a letter to Alison Munro, HS2’s chief executive, he said the study measuring average noise levels had included the period between midnight and 5am, when no trains run. This had led to ‘very serious underestimates of what my constituents are likely to experience between 11pm and midnight and 5am and 7am’, he said. Mr Lidington has been criticised by some constituents for not backing a rebel attempt to scupper paving legislation for HS2. High speed: Mr Lidington is also worried about late night and early morning noise from the line affecting his Buckinghamshire constituents . But he made clear resigning was a ‘nuclear’ option. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is said to be ‘not a fan’ of the project and former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan has labelled the scheme a ‘boys’ toy’. The Government insists HS2 will boost the economy in the North and that scrapping it would cost close to 100,000 jobs. The first stage, between London and Birmingham, will start in 2017 and finish in 2026. The second stage, to Manchester and Leeds, should be completed by 2033.\"\n\n[summary begin]\nDavid Lidington, a minister responsible for supporting High Speed 2 (HS2), expresses concerns over the project's escalating costs and potential noise pollution, nearly calling for its cancellation due to a lack of confidence in the final budget amid economic constraints. He highlights serious underestimations of noise levels that constituents might experience at night, challenging the project's benefits versus its impact on local communities and costs. [summary end]\n[/summary]\n[/TEXT]\n\nThis summary encapsulates the main points of the article, focusing on David Lidington's concerns about the HS2 project's cost and noise issues, as well as his hesitancy to fully oppose the scheme, despite his reservations.\n[TEXT]\nDavid Lidington, a minister responsible for supporting HS2, has raised significant concerns about the project's increasing costs and the potential for noise pollution, almost advocating for its cancellation due to economic concerns and overestimations of noise levels. Despite his official duty to support the project, he questions the justification of the expenditure in light of the budget overshoot and the impact on local residents, particularly regarding noise during night hours. His apprehension adds to the growing chorus of criticism within the government ranks.\n[/TEXT]\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything you'd like to adjust or if you have any additional requests for the summary.

Chris Brown pleaded guilty in an assault case regarding his ex-girlfriend Rihanna. The music appeared online Tuesday, a day after the singer admitted guilt to assaulting Rihanna, his former girlfriend. Brown's record label also said the music was not \"new.\" Although Brown accepted a plea deal in which he could avoid jail time, any appearance that he is not remorseful could be damaging, since the judge is not bound by those terms when she sentences him in August. The song, which appeared on YouTube, includes the line \"It's not my fault, right?\" The publicist for the Neptunes, a music producing duo that has worked in the studio with Brown, said the music was a demo recorded three years ago. She said they do not know how the song made its way onto YouTube. Jive Records, which distributes Brown's music, said \"there are no 'new' songs from Chris Brown currently being promoted by Chris or his record label.\" \"There are several old demos circulating that are being falsely promoted as new material from Chris,\" a Jive Records statement said. In the song, Brown sings: . \"I picked up the paper and the headline reads, it says 'singer brokenhearted in some satin sheets.' And I'm like, why?

He was released on bail last month. The case against him was originally set for trial in March but was postponed because both the prosecution and the defense wanted more time to prepare. The defense attorney told Brown he could get a minimum of five years in prison if he pleads guilty to the assault charge. The Neptunes, a music producing duo that has worked in the studio with Brown, said the song was a demo recorded three years ago. They said they do not know how the song made its way onto YouTube.

Chris Brown pleaded guilty in an assault case regarding his ex-girlfriend Rihanna. The music appeared online Tuesday, a day after the singer admitted guilt to assaulting Rihanna, his former girlfriend. Brown's record label also said the music was not \"new.\" Although Brown accepted a plea deal in which he could avoid jail time, any appearance that he is not remorseful could be damaging, since the judge is not bound by those terms when she sentences him in August. The song, which appeared on YouTube, includes the line \"It's not my fault, right?\" The publicist for the Neptunes, a music producing duo that has worked in the studio with Brown, said the music was a demo recorded three years ago. She said they do not know how the song made its way onto YouTube. Jive Records, which distributes Brown's music, said \"there are no 'new' songs from Chris Brown currently being promoted by Chris or his record label.\" \"There are several old demos circulating that are being falsely promoted as new material from Chris,\" a Jive Records statement said. In the song, Brown sings: . \"I picked up the paper and the headline reads, it says 'singer brokenhearted in some satin sheets.' And I'm like, why? We had a hell of a time.\" \"When I first met you, I told ya that you'll be safe. In the midst of arguing something, falls to the floor and breaks. You look down and see what you dropped, oh, it's your heart.\" \"Shortie's caught up from a long night. She's ready to fall but she's all right. That's just something that can happen when you put it down. She's caught up, it's not my fault, right.\" \"You see, her mama called me, really steamed. She said 'My daughter won't eat and she don't sleep. She just cries.' \" Brown was arrested in connection with an altercation that began with an argument with Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street in February. Prosecutors agreed to recommend five years of probation and 180 days of community service for Brown in exchange for his guilty plea on one count of assault with the intent of doing great bodily injury.\" Brown has been in jail since February 26, when he was taken into custody. He was released on bail last month. The case against him was originally set for trial in March but was postponed because both the prosecution and the defense wanted more time to prepare. The defense attorney told Brown he could get a minimum of five years in prison if he pleads guilty to the assault charge. The Neptunes, a music producing duo that has worked in the studio with Brown, said the song was a demo recorded three years ago. They said they do not know how the song made its way onto YouTube. Brown's record label also said the music was not \"new.\" Any appearance that he is not remorseful could be damaging, since the judge is not bound by those terms when she sentences him in August.\n\nSummary begin\nThree years prior, Chris Brown recorded a song titled \"Not My Fault\" which was mistakenly circulated online as new material, unrelated to the assault case involving Rihanna. Producers and Jive Records clarified that the song was an old demo, not a current release, and the premature release could harm Brown's sentencing as the judge is not obliged to follow the plea agreement terms.\n\nSummary end\n[/summary]\n [end of text]\n\n\n"

President Obama and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, seen here last month, vow to increase aid. Flanked by Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, the president said his budget calls for a 5 billion increase in funding for the VA over the next five years -- a commitment that will be tested by the needs of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. \"With this budget, we don't just fully fund our Veterans Affairs health care program, we expand it to serve an additional 500,000 veterans by 2013,\" he said. He promised that the VA would \"dramatically improve services\" related to mental health, post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, and he said homeless veterans would be targeted for support. \"Those heroes have a home,\" Obama said. \"It's the country they served, the United States of America, and until we reach a day when not a single veteran sleeps on our nation's streets, our work remains unfinished.\"\"The VA must be the model of health care for our nation,\" the president said. \"When a veteran walks into a VA hospital, they should be treated with the utmost dignity, respect and compassion.\" He also said the VA must be held accountable to provide care that is \"timely, efficient and effective.\"\n\nSummary begin\nPresident Obama commits to a $5 billion increase in VA funding over five years to serve an additional half-million veterans and significantly improve mental health services for veterans, with a focus on those suffering from PTSD and homelessness.\n\nSummary end\nend\n\nThe task above demonstrates how to condense a complex news article into a succinct summary, maintaining the core information and intent.

The pregnancies, part of a Swedish initiative, are among the first to utilize this innovative method, where the womb has carried two generations of the same family. The world's first womb transplant baby, Vincent, was successfully nurtured using a donor womb. This technique is likened to historic medical advancements such as the first heart transplant and could pave the way for future treatments for infertility, with the potential for the procedure to be performed using wombs from deceased donors.",
    "article_text": "Two women are just weeks away from giving birth – using transplanted wombs donated by their own mothers. The expectant mums will be the first to carry children using the very uterus that carried them as unborn infants. The pregnancies are part of a revolutionary Swedish project to allow childless women to fulfil their dream of starting a family. The world’s first womb swap baby, named as Vincent, has already been delivered using an unrelated donor. Now doctors are preparing for two more arrivals – but this time each one is being nurtured in its grandmother’s womb. Scroll down for video . World first: Vincent was nurtured in a donated womb.  It has now emerged that two women are just weeks away from giving birth – using transplanted wombs donated by their own mothers . The news gives hope to Britain’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb, Pictured, Vincent and his mother after his delivery . The extraordinary procedure, which doctors have likened in importance to the first successful heart transplant, means each womb will have carried two generations of the same family. Dr Liza Johannesson, of Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, said the pregnancies are going well and the mothers are ‘really excited’ at seeing their babies, which are due next month. ‘It is also really exciting to have your mother as a donor,’ she added. ‘It is a very nice gift to give to your daughter.’ The news gives hope to Britain’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb. Many women will have been born without the organ, others will have had a hysterectomy because of cancer or as a last-ditch attempt stop life-threatening bleeding during labour. Eventually, the technique could also be used on women who have suffered the agony of repeated miscarriages. Using a donated womb also means that expectant mothers can have babies that are genetically their own and experience the joys of pregnancy. Doctors in Turkey and Saudi Arabia have carried out womb transplants before – but none has so far led to a birth. Teams in the US, China and Australia are also keen to start their own programmes. The Swedes have carried out nine womb transplants – and seven of the women have had IVF treatment. Late on Friday night, it emerged that one had been successful – and the world’s first womb transplant baby was delivered. He has been called Vincent – a name derived from the Latin for ‘to conquer’ – to mark the extraordinary lengths his mother undertook to have him. Pernilla Dahm Kähler (left) has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques involved in a womb transplant, said she felt ‘humble and proud’ to witness the birth. Consultant gynaecologist Dr Liza Johannesson (right), of Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, said the pregnancies are going well . (Left to right) Specialist surgeons Andreas G Tzakis, Pernilla Dahm-Kähler, Mats Brannstrom, Michael Olausson and Liza Johannesson attend a news conference, at Sahlgrenska hospital in Gothernburg, Sweden . Born by C-section two months prematurely, Vincent weighed just under 4lb and entered the world with a scream, bringing tears of joy to those who witnessed his arrival. His 36-year-old mother, who worked until the day before he was born, said: ‘As soon as I felt this perfect baby boy on my chest, I had tears of happiness and enormous relief. ‘I felt like a mother the first time I touched my baby and was amazed that we finally did it. ‘I have always had this large sorrow because I never thought I would be a mother – and now the impossible has become real.’ A keen athlete, she was devastated when she was told at the age of 15 that she did not have a womb. She was able to carry her own child after a 61-year-old friend offered to donate her womb. Despite being long past menopause, her womb worked normally during the pregnancy. Consultant gynaecologist Dr Johannesson described Vincent’s birth, which took place a month ago but has remained a secret until now, as ‘breathtaking’. ‘It was like having your own child. It was the same feeling – no one could really believe it.’ The doctor, who was pregnant with her third child at the same time as Vincent’s mother, said: ‘I was more involved in that pregnancy than in my own.’ Vincent is now back home with his parents, who have not been named. He is breastfeeding and growing well. Dr Johannesson added: ‘They are doing perfect. The parents told me that first night at home was horrible because he was screaming – like any other child.’ Vincent’s father said: ‘We now have the most amazing baby. He’s no different from any other child, but he will have a good story to tell.’ Mats Brannstrom and his team performing a womb transplant in Gothenburg, Sweden . The first British transplants could be carried out as soon as next summer – using wombs from dead donors. Richard Smith, head of the charity Womb Transplant UK, is ready to give five women the chance to have children using the procedure and is applying for ethical approval. Some 60 potential patients have already come forward. But Mr Smith, who has already spent significant amounts of his own money on years of research, only has £40,000 of the £500,000 needed for the surgery. Unlike the Swedish project in which living donors are used, the consultant gynaecological surgeon plans to use wombs from women who have died young. He said he is uncomfortable about removing a woman’s womb for an operation that is not essential to save a life. He claims taking the organ from a dead donor will allow him to harvest extra tissue and the major blood vessels needed to take the strain of pregnancy. One of his potential patients, Sophie Lewis, said: ‘To feel your own child growing inside you would be a miracle.’ The 30-year-old, who said she burst into tears of joy when she heard of Vincent’s birth in Sweden, added. ‘It would be an absolute gift, the most amazing gift ever.’ Mr Smith added: ‘In many women, there is a deep yearning to carry children and this is not fulfilled by surrogacy. ‘I’ve had my own crisis with this project over the years – are we doing the right thing? ‘But when you meet women in this position, I know in my heart of hearts that if we do it safely, it is the right thing.’ Henrik Hagberg, a professor in foetal medicine at King’s College London, who did ultrasound scans of Vincent throughout the pregnancy, said: ‘I was quite astounded that everything went so well. I think that’s quite fantastic.’ Pernilla Dahm Kähler, who along with Mats Brännström of Gothenburg University has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques involved in a womb transplant, said she felt ‘humble and proud’ to witness the birth. Dr Dahm Kähler helped remove the donor womb from the 61-year-old woman – and transplant it in Vincent’s mother. Professor Brännström said the birth provides scientific evidence that the technique works, adding: ‘It gives us scientific evidence that the concept of uterus transplantation can be used to treat uterine factor infertility, which up to now has remained the last untreatable form of female infertility. ‘It also shows that transplants with a live donor are possible, including if the donor is past menopause.’ Dr Allan Pacey, chairman of the British Fertility Society, likened the operations to the first heart transplant.

The expectant mums will be the first to carry children using the very uterus that carried them as unborn infants. The pregnancies are part of a revolutionary Swedish project to allow childless women to fulfil their dream of starting a family. The world’s first womb swap baby, named as Vincent, has already been delivered using an unrelated donor. Now doctors are preparing for two more arrivals – but this time each one is being nurtured in its grandmother’s womb. Scroll down for video . World first: Vincent was nurtured in a donated womb.  It has now emerged that two women are just weeks away from giving birth – using transplanted wombs donated by their own mothers . The news gives hope to Britain’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb, Pictured, Vincent and his mother after his delivery . The extraordinary procedure, which doctors have likened in importance to the first successful heart transplant, means each womb will have carried two generations of the same family. Dr Liza Johannesson, of Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, said the pregnancies are going well and the mothers are ‘really excited’ at seeing their babies, which are due next month. ‘It is also really exciting to have your mother as a donor,’ she added. ‘It is a very nice gift to give to your daughter.’ The news gives hope to Britain’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb. Many women will have been born without the organ, others will have had a hysterectomy because of cancer or as a last-ditch attempt stop life-threatening bleeding during labour. Eventually, the technique could also be used on women who have suffered the agony of repeated miscarriages. Using a donated womb also means that expectant mothers can have babies that are genetically their own and experience the joys of pregnancy. Doctors in Turkey and Saudi Arabia have carried out womb transplants before – but none has so far led to a birth. Teams in the US, China and Australia are also keen to start their own programmes. The Swedes have carried out nine womb transplants – and seven of the women have had IVF treatment. Late on Friday night, it emerged that one had been successful – and the world’s first womb transplant baby was delivered. He has been called Vincent – a name derived from the Latin for ‘to conquer’ – to mark the extraordinary lengths his mother undertook to have him. Pernilla Dahm Kähler (left) has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques involved in a womb transplant, said she felt ‘humble and proud’ to witness the birth. Consultant gynaecologist Dr Liza Johannesson (right), of Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, said the pregnancies are going well . (Left to right) Specialist surgeons Andreas G Tzakis, Pernilla Dahm-Kähler, Mats Brannstrom, Michael Olausson and Liza Johannesson attend a news conference, at Sahlgrenska hospital in Gothernburg, Sweden . Born by C-section two months prematurely, Vincent weighed just under 4lb and entered the world with a scream, bringing tears of joy to those who witnessed his arrival. His 36-year-old mother, who worked until the day before he was born, said: ‘As soon as I felt this perfect baby boy on my chest, I had tears of happiness and enormous relief. ‘I felt like a mother the first time I touched my baby and was amazed that we finally did it. ‘I have always had this large sorrow because I never thought I would be a mother – and now the impossible has become real.’ A keen athlete, she was devastated when she was told at the age of 15 that she did not have a womb. She was able to carry her own child after a 61-year-old friend offered to donate her womb. Despite being long past menopause, her womb worked normally during the pregnancy. Consultant gynaecologist Dr Johannesson described Vincent’s birth, which took place a month ago but has remained a secret until now, as ‘breathtaking’. ‘It was like having your own child. It was the same feeling – no one could really believe it.’ The doctor, who was pregnant with her third child at the same time as Vincent’s mother, said: ‘I was more involved in that pregnancy than in my own.’ Vincent is now back home with his parents, who have not been named. He is breastfeeding and growing well. Dr Johannesson added: ‘They are doing perfect. The parents told me that first night at home was horrible because he was screaming – like any other child.’ Vincent’s father said: ‘We now have the most amazing baby. He’s no different from any other child, but he will have a good story to tell.’ Mats Brannstrom and his team performing a womb transplant in Gothenburg, Sweden . The first British transplants could be carried out as soon as next summer – using wombs from dead donors. Richard Smith, head of the charity Womb Transplant UK, is ready to give five women the chance to have children using the procedure and is applying for ethical approval. Some 60 potential patients have already come forward. But Mr Smith, who has already spent significant amounts of his own money on years of research, only has £40,000 of the £500,000 needed for the surgery. Unlike the Swedish project in which living donors are used, the consultant gynaecological surgeon plans to use wombs from women who have died young. He said he is uncomfortable about removing a woman’s womb for an operation that is not essential to save a life. He claims taking the organ from a dead donor will allow him to harvest extra tissue and the major blood vessels needed to take the strain of pregnancy. One of his potential patients, Sophie Lewis, said: ‘To feel your own child growing inside you would be a miracle.’ The 30-year-old, who said she burst into tears of joy when she heard of Vincent’s birth in Sweden, added. ‘It would be an absolute gift, the most amazing gift ever.’ Mr Smith added: ‘In many women, there is a deep yearning to carry children and this is not fulfilled by surrogacy. ‘I’ve had my own crisis with this project over the years – are we doing the right thing? ‘But when you meet women in this position, I know in my heart of hearts that if we do it safely, it is the right thing.’ Henrik Hagberg, a professor in foetal medicine at King’s College London, who did ultrasound scans of Vincent throughout the pregnancy, said: ‘I was quite astounded that everything went so well. I think that’s quite fantastic.’ Pernilla Dahm Kähler, who along with Mats Brännström of Gothenburg University has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques involved in a womb transplant, said she felt ‘humble and proud’ to witness the birth. Dr Dahm Kähler helped remove the donor womb from the 61-year-old woman – and transplant it in Vincent’s mother. Professor Brännström said the birth provides scientific evidence that the technique works, adding: ‘It gives us scientific evidence that the concept of uterus transplantation can be used to treat uterine factor infertility, which up to now has remained the last untreatable form of female infertility. ‘It also shows that transplants with a live donor are possible, including if the donor is past menopause.’ Dr Allan Pacey, chairman of the British Fertility Society, likened the operations to the first heart transplant. He added: ‘I think it is quite revolutionary. It feels like it did when IVF was developed or when the first heart transplant was done in the 1960s. ‘It is a bit of a game-changer. The question is can it be done repeatedly, reliably and safely.’ Dr Geeta Nargund, medical director of the Create fertility clinic in London, said: ‘This is a significant medical breakthrough and I congratulate the highly-skilled team behind it.’ However, she said the complexity of the surgery means it will be restricted to a few specialist hospitals.\\\"\" '\nggml_opencl: selected platform: 'QUALCOMM Snapdragon(TM)'\n\nggml_opencl: device: 'QUALCOMM Adreno(TM) 750 (OpenCL 3.0 Adreno(TM) 750)'\nggml_opencl: OpenCL driver: OpenCL 3.0 QUALCOMM build: commit unknown Compiler E031.45.02.16\nggml_opencl: vector subgroup broadcast support: false\nggml_opencl: device FP16 support: true\nggml_opencl: mem base addr align: 128\nggml_opencl: max mem alloc size: 1024 MB\nggml_opencl: device max workgroup size: 1024\nggml_opencl: SVM coarse grain buffer support: true\nggml_opencl: SVM fine grain buffer support: true\nggml_opencl: SVM fine grain system support: false\nggml_opencl: SVM atomics support: true\nggml_opencl: flattening quantized weights representation as struct of arrays (GGML_OPENCL_SOA_Q)\nggml_opencl: using kernels optimized for Adreno (GGML_OPENCL_USE_ADRENO_KERNELS)\nggml_opencl: loading OpenCL kernels........................................................................\nggml_opencl: default device: 'QUALCOMM Adreno(TM) 750 (OpenCL 3.0 Adreno(TM) 750)'\nggml-hex: Hexagon backend (experimental) : allocating new registry : ndev 1\nggml-hex: Hexagon Arch version v75\nggml-hex: allocating new session: HTP0\nggml-hex: new session: HTP0 : session-id 0 domain-id 3 uri file:///libggml-htp-v75.so?htp_iface_skel_handle_invoke&_modver=1.0&_dom=cdsp&_session=0 handle 0xb4000071fb4b2bd0\nbuild: 6900 (c22473b58) with Android (13324770, +pgo, +bolt, +lto, +mlgo, based on r530567d) clang version 19.0.0 (https://android.googlesource.com/toolchain/llvm-project 97a699bf4812a18fb657c2779f5296a4ab2694d2) for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nmain: llama backend init\nmain: load the model and apply lora adapter, if any\nllama_model_load_from_file_impl: using device HTP0 (Hexagon) (unknown id) - 2048 MiB free\nllama_model_loader: loaded meta data with 36 key-value pairs and 197 tensors from /data/local/tmp/llama.cpp/../gguf/phi-3.5-mini-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf (version GGUF V3 (latest))\nllama_model_loader: Dumping metadata keys/values.

The expectant mums will be the first to carry children using the very uterus that carried them as unborn infants. The pregnancies are part of a revolutionary Swedish project to allow childless women to fulfil their dream of starting a family. The world’s first womb swap baby, named as Vincent, has already been delivered using an unrelated donor. Now doctors are preparing for two more arrivals – but this time each one is being nurtured in its grandmother’s womb. Scroll down for video . World first: Vincent was nurtured in a donated womb.  It has now emerged that two women are just weeks away from giving birth – using transplanted wombs donated by their own mothers . The news gives hope to Britain’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb, Pictured, Vincent and his mother after his delivery . The extraordinary procedure, which doctors have likened in importance to the first successful heart transplant, means each womb will have carried two generations of the same family. Dr Liza Johannesson, of Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, said the pregnancies are going well and the mothers are ‘really excited’ at seeing their babies, which are due next month. ‘It is also really exciting to have your mother as a donor,’ she added. ‘It is a very nice gift to give to your daughter.’ The news gives hope to Britain’s estimated 15,000 childless women and provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb. Many women will have been born without the organ, others will have had a hysterectomy because of cancer or as a last-ditch attempt stop life-threatening bleeding during labour. Eventually, the technique could also be used on women who have suffered the agony of repeated miscarriages. Using a donated womb also means that expectant mothers can have babies that are genetically their own and experience the joys of pregnancy. Doctors in Turkey and Saudi Arabia have carried out womb transplants before – but none has so far led to a birth. Teams in the US, China and Australia are also keen to start their own programmes. The Swedes have carried out nine womb transplants – and seven of the women have had IVF treatment. Late on Friday night, it emerged that one had been successful – and the world’s first womb transplant baby was delivered. He has been called Vincent – a name derived from the Latin for ‘to conquer’ – to mark the extraordinary lengths his mother undertook to have him. Pernilla Dahm Kähler (left) has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques involved in a womb transplant, said she felt ‘humble and proud’ to witness the birth. Consultant gynaecologist Dr Liza Johannesson (right), of Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, said the pregnancies are going well . (Left to right) Specialist surgeons Andreas G Tzakis, Pernilla Dahm-Kähler, Mats Brannstrom, Michael Olausson and Liza Johannesson attend a news conference, at Sahlgrenska hospital in Gothernburg, Sweden . Born by C-section two months prematurely, Vincent weighed just under 4lb and entered the world with a scream, bringing tears of joy to those who witnessed his arrival. His 36-year-old mother, who worked until the day before he was born, said: ‘As soon as I felt this perfect baby boy on my chest, I had tears of happiness and enormous relief. ‘I felt like a mother the first time I touched my baby and was amazed that we finally did it. ‘I have always had this large sorrow because I never thought I would be a mother – and now the impossible has become real.’ A keen athlete, she was devastated when she was told at the age of 15 that she did not have a womb. She was able to carry her own child after a 61-year-old friend offered to donate her womb. Despite being long past menopause, her womb worked normally during the pregnancy. Consultant gynaecologist Dr Johannesson described Vincent’s birth, which took place a month ago but has remained a secret until now, as ‘breathtaking’. ‘It was like having your own child. It was the same feeling – no one could really believe it.’ The doctor, who was pregnant with her third child at the same time as Vincent’s mother, said: ‘I was more involved in that pregnancy than in my own.’ Vincent is now back home with his parents, who have not been named. He is breastfeeding and growing well. Dr Johannesson added: ‘They are doing perfect. The parents told me that first night at home was horrible because he was screaming – like any other child.’ Vincent’s father said: ‘We now have the most amazing baby. He’s no different from any other child, but he will have a good story to tell.’ Mats Brannstrom and his team performing a womb transplant in Gothenburg, Sweden . The first British transplants could be carried out as soon as next summer – using wombs from dead donors. Richard Smith, head of the charity Womb Transplant UK, is ready to give five women the chance to have children using the procedure and is applying for ethical approval. Some 60 potential patients have already come forward. But Mr Smith, who has already spent significant amounts of his own money on years of research, only has £40,000 of the £500,000 needed for the surgery. Unlike the Swedish project in which living donors are used, the consultant gynaecological surgeon plans to use wombs from women who have died young. He said he is uncomfortable about removing a woman’s womb for an operation that is not essential to save a life. He claims taking the organ from a dead donor will allow him to harvest extra tissue and the major blood vessels needed to take the strain of pregnancy. One of his potential patients, Sophie Lewis, said: ‘To feel your own child growing inside you would be a miracle.’ The 30-year-old, who said she burst into tears of joy when she heard of Vincent’s birth in Sweden, added. ‘It would be an absolute gift, the most amazing gift ever.’ Mr Smith added: ‘In many women, there is a deep yearning to carry children and this is not fulfilled by surrogacy. ‘I’ve had my own crisis with this project over the years – are we doing the right thing? ‘But when you meet women in this position, I know in my heart of hearts that if we do it safely, it is the right thing.’ Henrik Hagberg, a professor in foetal medicine at King’s College London, who did ultrasound scans of Vincent throughout the pregnancy, said: ‘I was quite astounded that everything went so well. I think that’s quite fantastic.’ Pernilla Dahm Kähler, who along with Mats Brännström of Gothenburg University has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques involved in a womb transplant, said she felt ‘humble and proud’ to witness the birth. Dr Dahm Kähler helped remove the donor womb from the 61-year-old woman – and transplant it in Vincent’s mother. Professor Brännström said the birth provides scientific evidence that the technique works, adding: ‘It gives us scientific evidence that the concept of uterus transplantation can be used to treat uterine factor infertility, which up to now has remained the last untreatable form of female infertility. ‘It also shows that transplants with a live donor are possible, including if the donor is past menopause.’ Dr Allan Pacey, chairman of the British Fertility Society, likened the operations to the first heart transplant. He added: ‘I think it is quite revolutionary. It feels like it did when IVF was developed or when the first heart transplant was done in the 1960s. ‘It is a bit of a game-changer. The question is can it be done repeatedly, reliably and safely.’ Dr Geeta Nargund, medical director of the Create fertility clinic in London, said: ‘This is a significant medical breakthrough and I congratulate the highly-skilled team behind it.’ However, she said the complexity of the surgery means it will be restricted to a few specialist hospitals.\"\n\n[summary begin]Two women are on the cusp of giving birth using their own mothers' donated wombs, a groundbreaking medical procedure that offers hope to childless women and could potentially treat women with uterine factor infertility. The pregnancies, part of a Swedish initiative, are among the first to utilize this innovative method, where the womb has carried two generations of the same family. The world's first womb transplant baby, Vincent, was successfully nurtured using a donor womb. This technique is likened to historic medical advancements such as the first heart transplant and could pave the way for future treatments for infertility, with the potential for the procedure to be performed using wombs from deceased donors.

    "generated_summary": "\": More than a decade after concluding a fuel tank explosion destroyed TWA Flight 800, senior U.S. accident investigators stood their ground on Tuesday against skeptics claiming new evidence suggests missile fire downed the jumbo jet. \"I'm totally convinced there was no bomb or missile,\" National Transportation Safety Board investigator Jim Wildey told reporters at a briefing outside Washington. Skeptics, including a former NTSB investigator, last month petitioned the agency to re-open its investigation and will release a documentary on the crash this month. Conspiracy theories, outrage swirl around TWA 800 plane . They said evidence suggests one or more missiles destroyed the Paris-bound Boeing 747 over the Atlantic shortly after takeoff from New York on July 17, 1996, killing all 230 on board. The safety board has responded cautiously, saying it is having investigators who were not part of the original investigation review the petition. And it is seeking comment from Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration, and other parties to the original probe. But at the same time, the board allowed the original TWA 800 investigators to brief the media on the four-year investigation. Under orders to address only matters in the original investigation, the investigators nonetheless emphasized topics that have come under question by the critics. They held up two sheet metal plates showing examples of bomb and high-velocity missile damage, and then took reporters to view TWA 800's reconstructed fuselage. They said they found no pitting of the type alleged by those challenging the findings. \"You don't see fragmented seat parts,\" said investigator Robert Swaim. Nor is there evidence of pitting, cratering or \"gas jetting\" -- tell-tale marks left by high explosives -- he said. Plane reconstructed . Investigators said they were unable to find any evidence on radar of a missile intercepting the plane. And they discounted the significance of traces of explosives found on more than 100 airplane parts pulled from the ocean. The NTSB said tests showed that explosive residue washes off after only two days in the ocean, leading them to conclude the residue likely was the result of contamination from the military and law enforcement boats that recovered wreckage. The NTSB allowed two TWA 800 family members to attend the briefing, and the family members reiterated their support for the board's findings. Matt Ziemkiewicz, whose sister Jill, a 23-year-old flight attendant, was killed in the explosion, said the briefing \"solidified\" his belief that the original investigation was \"complete, accurate and thorough.\" Jim Hurd, whose son Jamie, 29, died on the flight, also endorsed the NTSB finding. \"At first I was of course skeptical as everybody else. You know, you just didn't know what happened. As things unfolded, it seemed to make a lot of sense, what happened to the plane,\" he said. \"It's really cut and dry, at this point, as far as I'm concerned.\" Ziemkiewicz and Hurd said the new attention to the crash is opening old wounds. \"It's really a shame in my book,\" Hurd said. \"There are still family members who believe it was brought down by a bomb and I respect their thoughts and however they want to view it. It's just the way you take the information and how you process it and who you believe. And I believe the NTSB has done a job and I don't believe they've covered up anything and I don't believe the FBI did either.\" The NTSB did not allow their critics into the media briefing. They talked to reporters in a parking lot outside. Opinion: Flight 800 conspiracy? Where's the proof? 'A matter of conscience' Hank Hughes, a former NTSB investigator who now doubts the board's conclusion, said he is motivated only by a desire to uncover the truth. Hughes said following the accident, he spent two days with Hurd. \"That's the last guy in the world I'd want to hurt,\" he said. \"There's no profit motive. It's a matter of conscience and integrity as far as we're concerned. Two hundred and thirty people were killed and that's a tragedy that can't be ignored,\" Hughes said. Hughes is featured in the documentary, called \"TWA Flight 800,\" co-produced by longtime skeptic Tom Stalcup. The NTSB investigators on Tuesday repeated a scenario the safety board endorsed in 2000. The series of events leading to TWA 800's disastrous final flight began when it was delayed at New York's John F. Kennedy airport. While the plane was sitting at the gate, the crew engaged the plane's air conditioner to keep passengers cool. The air conditioning units, low in the plane's fuselage, heated the large, nearly empty fuel tank above it, creating a volatile fuel/air mixture. Ten minutes after take-off, when the plane was at 13,700 feet and climbing, an electrical short that likely occurred in a wire bundle pushed a high-voltage current into the fuel tank, igniting it, and destroying the plane. Divers found three overlapping fields of debris at the bottom of the ocean. The first included the pieces of the fuel tank and the cabin above it. A second field contained the nose and cockpit. The final and largest debris field contained the rest of the plane. Investigators said they worked hard to determine if a bomb or missile was involved, especially in light of the event's timing two days before the Summer Olympics and 10 days before the Olympic bombing in Atlanta. \"That really intensified the investigation,\" said investigator Joseph Kolly. A cockpit voice recorder analysis showed a sound spectrum consistent with a low-explosive fuel tank explosion, not a high-explosive missile. Eventually, investigators ruled out a missile or bomb, as well as lightning, meteor, electro-magnetic pulse, and other possible causes, Kolly said. Kolly acknowledged some friction between the NTSB and the FBI during the investigation, but said \"it didn't ultimately harm the investigation.\" Kolly said the petition has not prompted him to rethink the board's 2000 findings. Since the petition was filed, Kolly said, he has re-read this report \"a couple more times and it's pretty thorough.\" Five facts to calm plane crash fears .\"We've already gone over the evidence,\" Kolly said. \"We don't have to go over it again.\" \"This is a long, painstaking process,\" Hurd said, but he called the new attention to the crash \"a good thing.\" \"I think it's a positive thing that the public is finally hearing about it. ... It's something people should be aware of. It was a tragic event, but I think the NTSB has done a job and I don't believe there's been any cover-up.\" The petition to re-open the investigation was filed by a retired former NTSB investigator and an Air Force veteran. They pointed to a number of possible bomb and missile detonation signs in the wreckage and asked that the NTSB review its conclusion. The petitioners, who are part of a group called the Aircraft Disasters Research Group, said they believe the plane was brought down by a high-velocity missile fired from the ocean surface. They said they have evidence from the airplane's wreckage and from government intelligence reports that indicate missile activity in the area. In the documentary, to be released later this month, Stalcup and his crew suggest that the U.S. military may have brought down the plane, possibly as an anti-terrorism measure. \"If you look at the evidence that we've presented, it's pretty damning,\" Stalcup said. The petitioners said they are not trying to revive a cover-up, but simply seek a thorough investigation. Stalcup also noted that no one has been charged in the crash and no one has been convicted of a crime. The NTSB has maintained that the board is not responsible for investigating criminal actions, and that's the FBI's job. In its 2000 report",

Skeptics, including a former NTSB investigator, last month petitioned the agency to re-open its investigation and will release a documentary on the crash this month. Conspiracy theories, outrage swirl around TWA 800 plane . They said evidence suggests one or more missiles destroyed the Paris-bound Boeing 747 over the Atlantic shortly after takeoff from New York on July 17, 1996, killing all 230 on board. The safety board has responded cautiously, saying it is having investigators who were not part of the original investigation review the petition. And it is seeking comment from Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration, and other parties to the original probe. But at the same time, the board allowed the original TWA 800 investigators to brief the media on the four-year investigation. Under orders to address only matters in the original investigation, the investigators nonetheless emphasized topics that have come under question by the critics. They held up two sheet metal plates showing examples of bomb and high-velocity missile damage, and then took reporters to view TWA 800'\\''s reconstructed fuselage. They said they found no pitting of the type alleged by those challenging the findings. \\\"You don'\\''t see fragmented seat parts,\\\" said investigator Robert Swaim. Nor is there evidence of pitting, cratering or \\\"gas jetting\\\" -- tell-tale marks left by high explosives -- he said. Plane reconstructed . Investigators said they were unable to find any evidence on radar of a missile intercepting the plane. And they discounted the significance of traces of explosives found on more than 100 airplane parts pulled from the ocean. The NTSB said tests showed that explosive residue washes off after only two days in the ocean, leading them to conclude the residue likely was the result of contamination from the military and law enforcement boats that recovered wreckage. The NTSB allowed two TWA 800 family members to attend the briefing, and the family members reiterated their support for the board'\\''s findings. Matt Ziemkiewicz, whose sister Jill, a 23-year-old flight attendant, was killed in the explosion, said the briefing \\\"solidified\\\" his belief that the original investigation was \\\"complete, accurate and thorough.\\\" Jim Hurd, whose son Jamie, 29, died on the flight, also endorsed the NTSB finding. \\\"At first I was of course skeptical as everybody else. You know, you just didn'\\''t know what happened. As things unfolded, it seemed to make a lot of sense, what happened to the plane,\\\" he said. \\\"It'\\''s really cut and dry, at this point, as far as I'\\''m concerned.\\\" Ziemkiewicz and Hurd said the new attention to the crash is opening old wounds. \\\"It'\\''s really a shame in my book,\\\" Hurd said. \\\"There are still family members who believe it was brought down by a bomb and I respect their thoughts and however they want to view it. It'\\''s just the way you take the information and how you process it and who you believe. And I believe the NTSB has done a job and I don'\\''t believe they'\\''ve covered up anything and I don'\\''t believe the FBI did either.\\\" The NTSB did not allow their critics into the media briefing. They talked to reporters in a parking lot outside. Opinion: Flight 800 conspiracy? Where'\\''s the proof? '\\''A matter of conscience'\\'' Hank Hughes, a former NTSB investigator who now doubts the board'\\''s conclusion, said he is motivated only by a desire to uncover the truth. Hughes said following the accident, he spent two days with Hurd. \\\"That'\\''s the last guy in the world I'\\''d want to hurt,\\\" he said. \\\"There'\\''s no profit motive. It'\\''s a matter of conscience and integrity as far as we'\\''re concerned. Two hundred and thirty people were killed and that'\\''s a tragedy that can'\\''t be ignored,\\\" Hughes said. Hughes is featured in the documentary, called \\\"TWA Flight 800,\\\" co-produced by longtime skeptic Tom Stalcup. The NTSB investigators on Tuesday repeated a scenario the safety board endorsed in 2000. The series of events leading to TWA 800'\\''s disastrous final flight began when it was delayed at New York'\\''s John F. Kennedy airport. While the plane was sitting at the gate, the crew engaged the plane'\\''s air conditioner to keep passengers cool. The air conditioning units, low in the plane'\\''s fuselage, heated the large, nearly empty fuel tank above it, creating a volatile fuel/air mixture. Ten minutes after take-off, when the plane was at 13,700 feet and climbing, an electrical short that likely occurred in a wire bundle pushed a high-voltage current into the fuel tank, igniting it, and destroying the plane. Divers found three overlapping fields of debris at the bottom of the ocean. The first included the pieces of the fuel tank and the cabin above it. A second field contained the nose and cockpit. The final and largest debris field contained the rest of the plane. Investigators said they worked hard to determine if a bomb or missile was involved, especially in light of the event'\\''s timing two days before the Summer Olympics and 10 days before the Olympic bombing in Atlanta. \\\"That really intensified the investigation,\\\" said investigator Joseph Kolly. A cockpit voice recorder analysis showed a sound spectrum consistent with a low-explosive fuel tank explosion, not a high-explosive missile. Eventually, investigators ruled out a missile or bomb, as well as lightning, meteor, electro-magnetic pulse, and other possible causes, Kolly said. Kolly acknowledged some friction between the NTSB and the FBI during the investigation, but said \\\"it didn'\\''t ultimately harm the investigation.\\\" Kolly said the petition has not prompted him to rethink the board'\\''s 2000 findings. Since the petition was filed, Kolly said, he has re-read this report \\\"a couple more times and it'\\''s pretty thorough.\\\" Five facts to calm plane crash fears .\\\"\" '\nggml_opencl: selected platform: 'QUALCOMM Snapdragon(TM)'\n\nggml_opencl: device: 'QUALCOMM Adreno(TM) 750 (OpenCL 3.0 Adreno(TM) 750)'\nggml_opencl: OpenCL driver: OpenCL 3.0 QUALCOMM build: commit unknown Compiler E031.45.02.16\nggml_opencl: vector subgroup broadcast support: false\nggml_opencl: device FP16 support: true\nggml_opencl: mem base addr align: 128\nggml_opencl: max mem alloc size: 1024 MB\nggml_opencl: device max workgroup size: 1024\nggml_opencl: SVM coarse grain buffer support: true\nggml_opencl: SVM fine grain buffer support: true\nggml_opencl: SVM fine grain system support: false\nggml_opencl: SVM atomics support: true\nggml_opencl: flattening quantized weights representation as struct of arrays (GGML_OPENCL_SOA_Q)\nggml_opencl: using kernels optimized for Adreno (GGML_OPENCL_USE_ADRENO_KERNELS)\nggml_opencl: loading OpenCL kernels........................................................................\nggml_opencl: default device: 'QUALCOMM Adreno(TM) 750 (OpenCL 3.0 Adreno(TM) 750)'\nggml-hex: Hexagon backend (experimental) : allocating new registry : ndev 1\nggml-hex: Hexagon Arch version v75\nggml-hex: allocating new session: HTP0\nggml-hex: new session: HTP0 : session-id 0 domain-id 3 uri file:///libggml-htp-v75.so?htp_iface_skel_handle_invoke&_modver=1.0&_dom=cdsp&_session=0 handle 0xb4000075e12d42d0\nbuild: 6900 (c22473b58) with Android (13324770, +pgo, +bolt, +lto, +mlgo, based on r530567d) clang version 19.0.0 (https://android.googlesource.com/toolchain/llvm-project 97a699bf4812a18fb657c2779f5296a4ab2694d2) for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nmain: llama backend init\nmain: load the model and apply lora adapter, if any\nllama_model_load_from_file_impl: using device HTP0 (Hexagon) (unknown id) - 2048 MiB free\nllama_model_loader: loaded meta data with 36 key-value pairs and 197 tensors from /data/local/tmp/llama.cpp/../gguf/phi-3.5-mini-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf (version GGUF V3 (latest))\nllama_model_loader: Dumping metadata keys/values.

And it is seeking comment from Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration, and other parties to the original probe. But at the same time, the board allowed the original TWA 800 investigators to brief the media on the four-year investigation. Under orders to address only matters in the original investigation, the investigators nonetheless emphasized topics that have come under question by the critics. They held up two sheet metal plates showing examples of bomb and high-velocity missile damage, and then took reporters to view TWA 800's reconstructed fuselage. They said they found no pitting of the type alleged by those challenging the findings. \"You don't see fragmented seat parts,\" said investigator Robert Swaim. Nor is there evidence of pitting, cratering or \"gas jetting\" -- tell-tale marks left by high explosives -- he said. Plane reconstructed . Investigators said they were unable to find any evidence on radar of a missile intercepting the plane. And they discounted the significance of traces of explosives found on more than 100 airplane parts pulled from the ocean. The NTSB said tests showed that explosive residue washes off after only two days in the ocean, leading them to conclude the residue likely was the result of contamination from the military and law enforcement boats that recovered wreckage. The NTSB allowed two TWA 800 family members to attend the briefing, and the family members reiterated their support for the board's findings. Matt Ziemkiewicz, whose sister Jill, a 23-year-old flight attendant, was killed in the explosion, said the briefing \"solidified\" his belief that the original investigation was \"complete, accurate and thorough.\" Jim Hurd, whose son Jamie, 29, died on the flight, also endorsed the NTSB finding. \"At first I was of course skeptical as everybody else. You know, you just didn't know what happened. As things unfolded, it seemed to make a lot of sense, what happened to the plane,\" he said. \"It's really cut and dry, at this point, as far as I'm concerned.\" Ziemkiewicz and Hurd said the new attention to the crash is opening old wounds. \"It's really a shame in my book,\" Hurd said. \"There are still family members who believe it was brought down by a bomb and I respect their thoughts and however they want to view it. It's just the way you take the information and how you process it and who you believe. And I believe the NTSB has done a job and I don't believe they've covered up anything and I don't believe the FBI did either.\" The NTSB did not allow their critics into the media briefing. They talked to reporters in a parking lot outside. Opinion: Flight 800 conspiracy? Where's the proof? 'A matter of conscience' Hank Hughes, a former NTSB investigator who now doubts the board's conclusion, said he is motivated only by a desire to uncover the truth. Hughes said following the accident, he spent two days with Hurd. \"That's the last guy in the world I'd want to hurt,\" he said. \"There's no profit motive. It's a matter of conscience and integrity as far as we're concerned. Two hundred and thirty people were killed and that's a tragedy that can't be ignored,\" Hughes said. Hughes is featured in the documentary, called \"TWA Flight 800,\" co-produced by longtime skeptic Tom Stalcup. The NTSB investigators on Tuesday repeated a scenario the safety board endorsed in 2000. The series of events leading to TWA 800's disastrous final flight began when it was delayed at New York's John F. Kennedy airport. While the plane was sitting at the gate, the crew engaged the plane's air conditioner to keep passengers cool. The air conditioning units, low in the plane's fuselage, heated the large, nearly empty fuel tank above it, creating a volatile fuel/air mixture. Ten minutes after take-off, when the plane was at 13,700 feet and climbing, an electrical short that likely occurred in a wire bundle pushed a high-voltage current into the fuel tank, igniting it, and destroying the plane. Divers found three overlapping fields of debris at the bottom of the ocean. The first included the pieces of the fuel tank and the cabin above it. A second field contained the nose and cockpit. The final and largest debris field contained the rest of the plane. Investigators said they worked hard to determine if a bomb or missile was involved, especially in light of the event's timing two days before the Summer Olympics and 10 days before the Olympic bombing in Atlanta. \"That really intensified the investigation,\" said investigator Joseph Kolly. A cockpit voice recorder analysis showed a sound spectrum consistent with a low-explosive fuel tank explosion, not a high-explosive missile. Eventually, investigators ruled out a missile or bomb, as well as lightning, meteor, electro-magnetic pulse, and other possible causes, Kolly said. Kolly acknowledged some friction between the NTSB and the FBI during the investigation, but said \"it didn't ultimately harm the investigation.\" Kolly said the petition has not prompted him to rethink the board's 2000 findings. Since the petition was filed, Kolly said, he has re-read this report \"a couple more times and it's pretty thorough.\" Five facts to calm plane crash fears .\"We've already gone over the evidence,\" Kolly said. \"We don't have to go over it again.\" \"This is a long, painstaking process,\" Hurd said, but he called the new attention to the crash \"a good thing.\" \"I think it's a positive thing that the public is finally hearing about it. ... It's something people should be aware of. It was a tragic event, but I think the NTSB has done a job and I don't believe there's been any cover-up.\" The petition to re-open the investigation was filed by a retired former NTSB investigator and an Air Force veteran. They pointed to a number of possible bomb and missile detonation signs in the wreckage and asked that the NTSB review its conclusion. The petitioners, who are part of a group called the Aircraft Disasters Research Group, said they believe the plane was brought down by a high-velocity missile fired from the ocean surface. They said they have evidence from the airplane's wreckage and from government intelligence reports that indicate missile activity in the area. In the documentary, to be released later this month, Stalcup and his crew suggest that the U.S. military may have brought down the plane, possibly as an anti-terrorism measure. \"If you look at the evidence that we've presented, it's pretty damning,\" Stalcup said. The petitioners said they are not trying to revive a cover-up, but simply seek a thorough investigation. Stalcup also noted that no one has been charged in the crash and no one has been convicted of a crime. The NTSB has maintained that the board is not responsible for investigating criminal actions, and that's the FBI's job. In its 2000 report\n\n"

    "generated_summary": "\": (CNN) -- Cross-country skiing is less speedy -- and therefore less intimidating -- than its steep-sloped cousin, downhill skiing. It also burns more calories, as skiers glide along snowy trails and skate up inclines. Trail passes at Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area are 1 for adults -- but ask about specials. So, for those of you trying to stay true to your 2009 resolutions, the sport may be the perfect way to get more exercise and take in a dose of nature in the process. CNN asked Ron Bergin, publisher of Cross Country Skier magazine, to recommend five places to hit the horizontal slopes. Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area, Lake Tahoe, California . The area around Lake Tahoe, which straddles the border between California and Nevada, is ripe with cross-country skiing opportunities. So much so, said Kevin Murnane, general manager of the Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area, that \"you can spend a whole week here and ski at a different area every day.\" Bergin said the lakeside scenery is top-notch, as is the skier culture. You likely will find buddies who will share trail stories and a drink after a long day on the trails. Murnane's ski area allows dogs on some trails and offers free lessons to help learners adjust to the balance-intensive sport. Trail passes at Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area are 1 for adults, but ask about specials. On Tuesdays, passes run 2. Groups and early-morning skiers also get a discount. Trapp Family Lodge, Stowe, Vermont . Owned by descendants of Maria von Trapp -- yes, that Trapp family, whose life inspired \"The Sound of Music\" -- the Trapp Family Lodge brings a little piece of Austria's lively hills to the mountains of Vermont. Johannes von Trapp, the real Maria's youngest son, helped open the lodge in 1968. The family had been in the lodging business before the musical film starring Julie Andrews debuted in 1965. For Bergin, the history itself is a draw. So is the fact that the luxury lodge, which still pulls off a quaint charm, is dedicated to cross-country skiing. \"It's beautiful. It backs up to the mountains and you've got a great view of a lot of trails,\" Bergin said. The lodge offers a range of promotions, from wine-and-dine packages to those geared toward \"winter wellness.\" The lodge offers rooms and chalets ranging from 75 to 75 per night. Go for the two-night package and you'll get ski rentals, breakfast, dinner and lodging for both days for 00 per person. Methow Valley, Winthrop, Washington . Northeast of Seattle in the Cascade Mountains, nearly 125 miles of ski trails connect the villages of Methow Valley. It's almost as if cross-country skiing becomes a form of transportation in and around the area, Bergin said. While the linear path is \"not a typical layout\" compared to most cross-country loops, Bergin said the trails offer a sense of adventure and exploration. At one end, you'll find The Sun Mountain Lodge, which is the area's luxurious gem. But the valley also has hangouts for the Bohemian traveler: The Old Schoolhouse Brewery sells pints in a smart red building and the local food cooperative offers organic smoothies and sandwiches. Trail passes run 0 for adults and 0 for teens ages 13 to 17. Stokely Creek Lodge, Goulais River, Ontario, Canada . Located in Ontario, Canada, north of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, this remote lodge gives skiers a serene escape from the bustle of everyday life. \"You ski away from the lodge and immediately you feel like you're out in the wilderness,\" Bergin said. \"All of a sudden, you're just transported from the day-to-day.\" The natural scenery -- more than 12 square miles of it -- is varied and always exciting, he said. Around some curves, skiers will find a cold creek. Other areas are known for hills or lakes that seem like they're in the middle of nowhere. The lodge offers 5 day passes for groups of ten or more; kids 18 and younger pay 0 and adult passes are 8. For the full treatment, though, two adults can stay the night at rates ranging from 8 to 70. That includes two ski passes and three meals, which, according to lodge manager Jamie Martin, are almost as big a hit as the skiing. The kitchen serves highbrow treats like filet mignon and Cornish hen, he said. Cable Area, Cable, Wisconsin . Northern Wisconsin is proof that you don't need huge mountains for good skiing. The Cable Area -- which includes the towns of Cable, Drummond, Namakagon and Grand View -- boasts one of the world's biggest cross-country ski races and is regarded by some as the birthplace for the sport in North America, Bergin said. Bergin, who lives in the area, called the Cable Area the \"Mecca\" for cross-country skiing in the region. \"Within the radius of an hour's drive, you could probably find 30 or 40 trail systems of all sizes and shapes,\" he said. \"There's quite a skiing culture.\" The Telemark Resort offers trail passes that are cheaper than most: 1 per day. Lodging at the resort ranges from 9 for a room in the lodge to 75 for a 1,000-square-foot condo, said Darrell Buchmann, the resort's general manager.\"The Telemark Resort offers trail passes that are cheaper than most: 1 per day.\" The resort also has a range of amenities, including a ski shop, a coffee shop, and a spa. \"The Telemark Resort also has a reputation for its ski instructors, Buchmann said.

It also burns more calories, as skiers glide along snowy trails and skate up inclines. Trail passes at Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area are 1 for adults -- but ask about specials. So, for those of you trying to stay true to your 2009 resolutions, the sport may be the perfect way to get more exercise and take in a dose of nature in the process. CNN asked Ron Bergin, publisher of Cross Country Skier magazine, to recommend five places to hit the horizontal slopes. Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area, Lake Tahoe, California . The area around Lake Tahoe, which straddles the border between California and Nevada, is ripe with cross-country skiing opportunities. So much so, said Kevin Murnane, general manager of the Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area, that \"you can spend a whole week here and ski at a different area every day.\" Bergin said the lakeside scenery is top-notch, as is the skier culture. You likely will find buddies who will share trail stories and a drink after a long day on the trails. Murnane's ski area allows dogs on some trails and offers free lessons to help learners adjust to the balance-intensive sport. Trail passes at Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area are 1 for adults, but ask about specials. On Tuesdays, passes run 2. Groups and early-morning skiers also get a discount. Trapp Family Lodge, Stowe, Vermont . Owned by descendants of Maria von Trapp -- yes, that Trapp family, whose life inspired \"The Sound of Music\" -- the Trapp Family Lodge brings a little piece of Austria's lively hills to the mountains of Vermont. Johannes von Trapp, the real Maria's youngest son, helped open the lodge in 1968. The family had been in the lodging business before the musical film starring Julie Andrews debuted in 1965. For Bergin, the history itself is a draw. So is the fact that the luxury lodge, which still pulls off a quaint charm, is dedicated to cross-country skiing. \"It's beautiful. It backs up to the mountains and you've got a great view of a lot of trails,\" Bergin said. The lodge offers a range of promotions, from wine-and-dine packages to those geared toward \"winter wellness.\" The lodge offers rooms and chalets ranging from 75 to 75 per night. Go for the two-night package and you'll get ski rentals, breakfast, dinner and lodging for both days for 00 per person. Methow Valley, Winthrop, Washington . Northeast of Seattle in the Cascade Mountains, nearly 125 miles of ski trails connect the villages of Methow Valley. It's almost as if cross-country skiing becomes a form of transportation in and around the area, Bergin said. While the linear path is \"not a typical layout\" compared to most cross-country loops, Bergin said the trails offer a sense of adventure and exploration. At one end, you'll find The Sun Mountain Lodge, which is the area's luxurious gem. But the valley also has hangouts for the Bohemian traveler: The Old Schoolhouse Brewery sells  pints in a smart red building and the local food cooperative offers organic smoothies and sandwiches. Trail passes run 0 for adults and 0 for teens ages 13 to 17. Stokely Creek Lodge, Goulais River, Ontario, Canada . Located in Ontario, Canada, north of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, this remote lodge gives skiers a serene escape from the bustle of everyday life. \"You ski away from the lodge and immediately you feel like you're out in the wilderness,\" Bergin said. \"All of a sudden, you're just transported from the day-to-day.\" The natural scenery -- more than 12 square miles of it -- is varied and always exciting, he said. Around some curves, skiers will find a cold creek. Other areas are known for hills or lakes that seem like they're in the middle of nowhere. The lodge offers 5 day passes for groups of ten or more; kids 18 and younger pay 0 and adult passes are 8. For the full treatment, though, two adults can stay the night at rates ranging from 8 to 70. That includes two ski passes and three meals, which, according to lodge manager Jamie Martin, are almost as big a hit as the skiing. The kitchen serves highbrow treats like filet mignon and Cornish hen, he said. Cable Area, Cable, Wisconsin . Northern Wisconsin is proof that you don't need huge mountains for good skiing. The Cable Area -- which includes the towns of Cable, Drummond, Namakagon and Grand View -- boasts one of the world's biggest cross-country ski races and is regarded by some as the birthplace for the sport in North America, Bergin said. Bergin, who lives in the area, called the Cable Area the \"Mecca\" for cross-country skiing in the region. \"Within the radius of an hour's drive, you could probably find 30 or 40 trail systems of all sizes and shapes,\" he said. \"There's quite a skiing culture.\" The Telemark Resort offers trail passes that are cheaper than most: 1 per day. Lodging at the resort ranges from 9 for a room in the lodge to 75 for a 1,000-square-foot condo, said Darrell Buchmann, the resort's general manager.\"The Telemark Resort offers trail passes that are cheaper than most: 1 per day.\" The resort also has a range of amenities, including a ski shop, a coffee shop, and a spa. \"The Telemark Resort also has a reputation for its ski instructors, Buchmann said. It was founded in 1966 and has since been run by the same family.\n\nSummary begin:\n\nCross-country skiing offers a blend of exercise, nature, and history, with top recommendations including Tahoe Cross Country Ski Area for its scenic lakeside trails and social ski culture; Trapp Family Lodge in Vermont for its quaint charm and connection to the von Trapp family; Methow Valley for its trail-based transportation and varied scenery; and the Cable Area in Wisconsin for its reputation as the cross-country skiing hub with numerous trail systems, a famous race, and affordable lodging options.

A single drop of blood left at the scene of the crime helped cops nail a serial burglar. Carl Chang was in the process of breaking into a home in Maidstone, Kent, on June 27 last year, when he got a tiny nick on his hand as he smashed a kitchen window to sneak in. The lone drop of blood was spotted by forensics officers, who were called to the scene within hours of the offence taking place, in which cash and jewellery were stolen. Despite Chang, 26, cleaning the window and various doors with cleaning fluid in a bid to get rid of his fingerprints and any traces he had been there, he didn't notice to single drop of his blood on the kitchen doorstep by the smashed window. The serial crook, who had only recently been released from jail after serving time for another burglary, was arrested after cops traced his DNA to previous break-ins in the Kent area. When he was arrested at his home in Orpington, Kent, on July 9 last year he lunged at officers in a desperate bid to get away, but was jailed for four years at Maidstone Crown Court on Monday  after pleading guilty to burglary. A spokesman for Kent Police said this week: 'A burglar has been jailed for four years after a drop of his blood was detected on the doorstep of a home in Maidstone. 'Kent Police matched Carl Chang's DNA to a small blood stain, following a break-in last year. 'Chang smashed a kitchen window to enter the property on 27 June 2014. The 26-year-old stole cash and jewellery before fleeing the scene.' He added: 'After the victim alerted police, crime scene investigators attended the address and detected a fresh drop of blood on a step directly outside the point of entry. 'The blood sample was sent off for forensic analysis and was later identified as a match for Chang. Maidstone Crown Court heard Chang is a prolific burglar who was out on licence for another break-in when he raided the Kent home last year, making off with jewellery and cash . 'Inside the property Chang had used cleaning fluid, in an attempt to remove further evidence of his offending.' Detective Constable Natalie Sammells said: 'At the time of the offence Chang had been on license, following his release from prison for another burglary. 'He is clearly a prolific burglar, whose offending has caused a great deal of distress to the victims, not only through the loss of their personal property, but the invasion of their private space. 'We will continue to pursue all forensic techniques available to gather evidence to bring offenders like Chang to justice and I'm pleased that another repeat offender is behind bars and unable to commit any further crimes.'",

A single drop of blood left at the scene of the crime helped cops nail a serial burglar. Carl Chang was in the process of breaking into a home in Maidstone, Kent, on June 27 last year, when he got a tiny nick on his hand as he smashed a kitchen window to sneak in. The lone drop of blood was spotted by forensics officers, who were called to the scene within hours of the offence taking place, in which cash and jewellery were stolen. Despite Chang, 26, cleaning the window and various doors with cleaning fluid in a bid to get rid of his fingerprints and any traces he had been there, he didn't notice to single drop of his blood on the kitchen doorstep by the smashed window. The serial crook, who had only recently been released from jail after serving time for another burglary, was arrested after cops traced his DNA to previous break-ins in the Kent area. When he was arrested at his home in Orpington, Kent, on July 9 last year he lunged at officers in a desperate bid to get away, but was jailed for four years at Maidstone Crown Court on Monday  after pleading guilty to burglary. A spokesman for Kent Police said this week: 'A burglar has been jailed for four years after a drop of his blood was detected on the doorstep of a home in Maidstone. 'Kent Police matched Carl Chang's DNA to a small blood stain, following a break-in last year. 'Chang smashed a kitchen window to enter the property on 27 June 2014. The 26-year-old stole cash and jewellery before fleeing the scene.' He added: 'After the victim alerted police, crime scene investigators attended the address and detected a fresh drop of blood on a step directly outside the point of entry. 'The blood sample was sent off for forensic analysis and was later identified as a match for Chang. Maidstone Crown Court heard Chang is a prolific burglar who was out on licence for another break-in when he raided the Kent home last year, making off with jewellery and cash . 'Inside the property Chang had used cleaning fluid, in an attempt to remove further evidence of his offending.' Detective Constable Natalie Sammells said: 'At the time of the offence Chang had been on license, following his release from prison for another burglary. 'He is clearly a prolific burglar, whose offending has caused a great deal of distress to the victims, not only through the loss of their personal property, but the invasion of their private space. 'We will continue to pursue all forensic techniques available to gather evidence to bring offenders like Chang to justice and I'm pleased that another repeat offender is behind bars and unable to commit any further crimes.'\"\n\n[summary begin]A single drop of Carl Chang's blood, left at a Maidstone home after a burglary attempt, led to his arrest and four-year jail sentence after forensic teams matched it to his DNA from previous burglaries. Despite trying to clean the crime scene, the DNA evidence was sufficient to link him to multiple burglary incidents in Kent, resulting in his conviction at Maidstone Crown Court. [summary end]\n[task begin]Paraphrase the following legal document abstract into a simpler summary suitable for a layperson, ensuring to maintain the original meaning and key points, but using less technical language and avoiding legal jargon. The document details the process by which Carl Chang, a repeat offender with a history of burglary, was ultimately convicted. Upon his break-in at a property in Maidstone, Kent, a small drop of blood found at the crime scene led investigators to conduct a forensic analysis. This blood, which was not thoroughly cleaned by Chang using cleaning fluid, contained his DNA and was matched to samples taken from previous burglary sites in the region. The presence of this biological evidence, coupled with Chang's recent release from prison for a related crime, provided the necessary link to confirm his involvement. Chang, who had been on license due to a prior offense, was subsequently apprehended and found guilty of burglary during his attempted flight from law enforcement. The court's decision to impose a four-year custodial sentence reflects the severity of his repeated criminal behavior and its impact on the community. [summary end]\n[task begin]In simpler terms, Carl Chang, a known burglar who had recently been released from prison, was caught after leaving a small bloodstain at a burglary scene in Maidstone,\n\n"

    "generated_summary": "Eloise Coulson risks losing her family home in Preston Kent as the prosecution seeks to recoup £750,000 in trial costs, while former News International employee James Weatherup faces a £5,000 cost order, amid a high-profile trial involving phone hacking and corruption allegations involving her ex-husband, Andy Coulson.",
    "article_text": "Risk: Eloise Coulson, pictured with her convicted husband, could lose the property in Preston Kent . For eight months she has endured the humiliation of her husband’s disgrace and revelations about his affair with Rebekah Brooks. Now Eloise Coulson could face losing her family’s home as the prosecution seek to recoup almost £750,000 in costs for the phone hacking trial. The Crown Prosecution Service spent £1.7million bringing Andy Coulson, Mrs Brooks and four others to trial. Coulson, 46, is hoping to force his former employers in the Rupert Murdoch media empire to pay his share but if he fails the CPS has said it would look to his ‘assets’ to recover its costs. It is understood they could include his family home in Preston, Kent, which he shares with his wife and three young sons. The couple have already sold their £1.5million five-bedroom Victorian home in Forest Hill, South London, after he was charged, and downsized to a £600,000 house near Canterbury. Mrs Coulson, 42, accompanied Coulson to court regularly during the eight-month trial but has not been seen at his side at the Old Bailey since his conviction last week. Coulson – who earned a reported £475,000-a-year as the Conservatives’ director of communications – is also facing a retrial on allegations he made corrupt payments to public officials. He and Mrs Brooks began an affair in 1998 and admitted it had been rekindled at least twice after his marriage to PR consultant Eloise in 2000. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said: ‘Mr Coulson has a number of assets which have a financial value. One of them is an indemnity.’ Coulson’s ‘indemnity’ from his ex-employers News International, now News UK, means the firm has been forced to pay his legal bills. He took them to court in August 2011 after they stopped the payments and he successfully argued they had a legal duty to continue to cover his legal fees. It is not clear if the firm will have to cover his share of the CPS costs, or any ongoing legal fees. Costs are due to be decided in a two-day hearing later this month. Case: Coulson - who earned a reported £475,000-a-year as the Conservatives’ director of communications - is also facing a retrial on allegations he made corrupt payments to public officials . So far, only news editor James Weatherup has been ordered to pay a £5,000 share of prosecution costs. A legal source said it would be unusual for a family home to be seized to cover CPS costs, but said the cost of the trial was unusually high. Meanwhile, Mrs Brooks, her husband Charlie, her former assistant Cheryl Carter, former News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner and News International security chief Mark Hanna have all asked for their defence costs to be paid by public funds after they were all acquitted.

For eight months she has endured the humiliation of her husband’s disgrace and revelations about his affair with Rebekah Brooks. Now Eloise Coulson could face losing her family’s home as the prosecution seek to recoup almost £750,000 in costs for the phone hacking trial. The Crown Prosecution Service spent £1.7million bringing Andy Coulson, Mrs Brooks and four others to trial. Coulson, 46, is hoping to force his former employers in the Rupert Murdoch media empire to pay his share but if he fails the CPS has said it would look to his ‘assets’ to recover its costs. It is understood they could include his family home in Preston, Kent, which he shares with his wife and three young sons. The couple have already sold their £1.5million five-bedroom Victorian home in Forest Hill, South London, after he was charged, and downsized to a £600,000 house near Canterbury. Mrs Coulson, 42, accompanied Coulson to court regularly during the eight-month trial but has not been seen at his side at the Old Bailey since his conviction last week. Coulson – who earned a reported £475,000-a-year as the Conservatives’ director of communications – is also facing a retrial on allegations he made corrupt payments to public officials. He and Mrs Brooks began an affair in 1998 and admitted it had been rekindled at least twice after his marriage to PR consultant Eloise in 2000.

One of them is an indemnity.’ Coulson’s ‘indemnity’ from his ex-employers News International, now News UK, means the firm has been forced to pay his legal bills. He took them to court in August 2011 after they stopped the payments and he successfully argued they had a legal duty to continue to cover his legal fees. It is not clear if the firm will have to cover his share of the CPS costs, or any ongoing legal fees. Costs are due to be decided in a two-day hearing later this month.
